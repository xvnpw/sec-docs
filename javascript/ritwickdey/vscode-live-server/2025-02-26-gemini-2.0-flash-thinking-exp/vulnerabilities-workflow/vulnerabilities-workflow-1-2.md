- **Vulnerability Name:** Directory Traversal / Arbitrary File Read  
  **Description:**  
  An attacker may be able to request files outside of the intended workspace root if the live server’s file–serving logic does not correctly sanitize URL paths. For instance, if the server is exposed on an external network (by setting “liveServer.settings.useLocalIp” to true or by altering “liveServer.settings.host”), an attacker can send an HTTP GET request that includes traversal sequences (e.g. “../”) in the URL. Step by step, the attacker would:  
  1. Discover the publicly accessible server (for example, via network scanning or by knowing the developer’s IP configuration).  
  2. Exploit the fact that the configuration “liveServer.settings.root” is used to define the document root, meaning that if the underlying code simply concatenates the request path with the configured root, path traversal (using “../”) may be possible.  
  3. Request a URL such as “http://<public‐ip>:<port>/../package.json” or “http://<public‐ip>:<port>/../../sensitiveFile” to retrieve files outside the intended directory.  
     
  **Impact:**  
  An attacker could read arbitrary files from the host running the live server—including source files and configuration files (which might include secrets). This disclosure could lead to further attacks such as credential compromise or expose internal application structure.  
  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - By default, the extension binds the server to “127.0.0.1” and “liveServer.settings.useLocalIp” is false. This means that unless a user explicitly enables external access, the server is not accessible to remote attackers.  
  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no evidence (in the provided documentation) that the file–serving component applies robust path normalization or sanitization to disallow “../” sequences.  
  - A safety mechanism to compare the resolved absolute file path against the configured workspace root is not documented.  
  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The live server must be running and accessible on a network interface beyond localhost.  
  - The server’s file–serving logic must not enforce strict path resolution (i.e. if it simply appends the URL path to the “liveServer.settings.root”, it is vulnerable).  
  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  Although the actual file–serving source code is not included in the PROJECT FILES, the documentation indicates that the root of served files is configurable via “liveServer.settings.root”. In many similar implementations, the incoming URL is appended to the document root without sufficient normalization. For example, the code flow may follow these steps:  
  - Receive HTTP GET request with URL “/../package.json”.  
  - Combine the request path with the configured root (say, “/workspace/”) resulting in “/workspace/../package.json”.  
  - Without resolution (or if the resolution is naïvely implemented), the server may ultimately read “/package.json” or a file outside the workspace.  
  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a test environment, configure the live server to bind to an externally accessible IP by setting either  
     - `"liveServer.settings.useLocalIp": true`  
       or  
     - `"liveServer.settings.host": "0.0.0.0"` (or an appropriate network IP) in the settings.  
  2. Set “liveServer.settings.root” to a known directory (e.g., the test workspace).  
  3. Launch the server.  
  4. From an external machine (or using a tool like curl/Postman), issue an HTTP GET request with a URL designed to traverse directories, for example:  
     - `GET http://<test-ip>:5500/../package.json`  
  5. Observe if the server returns the contents of “package.json” or another file outside the intended workspace.  
  6. If sensitive files are disclosed, the issue is confirmed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Server–Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Proxy Feature Misconfiguration  
  **Description:**  
  The extension supports a proxy feature (configurable via “liveServer.settings.proxy”) which lets the live server forward incoming requests to a designated “proxyUri.” If the implementation naively appends the client–supplied URL path to the configured “proxyUri” without proper validation or sanitization, an attacker may manipulate the request URL to force the server to make requests to arbitrary internal endpoints. Step by step, the attacker would:  
  1. Note the configured proxy parameters (e.g. “baseUri” and “proxyUri”) as documented.  
  2. Craft a malicious request such as sending a URL with extra “../” sequences or appended unexpected path segments.  
  3. Exploit the lack of input validation such that the server resolves the target URL to an internal resource not intended to be exposed, thereby relaying the attacker’s request internally.  
  
  **Impact:**  
  An attacker could make the server send HTTP requests to internal systems (for example, internal metadata services or administration interfaces), potentially retrieving sensitive data or causing unintended side–effects. This can lead to internal service compromise or data leakage.  
  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The proxy feature is disabled by default (`"enable": false`), meaning it is not active unless explicitly turned on in a configuration file.  
  - The documentation assumes that “baseUri” and “proxyUri” are set statically by the deployment owner.  
  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no documented requirement for robust URL sanitization or strict validation checks on the request path before it is appended to the “proxyUri.”  
  - No additional access controls (such as IP whitelisting or request filtering) are mentioned for proxy operations.  
  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The live server must be running with the proxy feature enabled (i.e. `"liveServer.settings.proxy.enable": true`).  
  - The server must be accessible externally such that an attacker can send crafted URLs to it.  
  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  While the full implementation is not shown, the “docs/settings.md” file reveals that the proxy configuration accepts two parameters: a “baseUri” (the path from which proxying starts) and a “proxyUri” (the actual target for proxied requests). A common insecure implementation might simply take the incoming request’s URL, remove the “baseUri” portion, and append the remainder to “proxyUri” without checking for path traversal or unexpected segments. For example, a request path like `/base/../../internal/admin` might be improperly resolved to a URL targeting an internal admin interface.  
  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a controlled test environment, configure the live server with the proxy feature enabled in the settings file as follows:
     - `"liveServer.settings.proxy": { "enable": true, "baseUri": "/", "proxyUri": "http://internal-test-server/" }`
  2. Launch the live server.  
  3. From an external client, send an HTTP request with a manipulated URL path—for example:
     - `GET http://<test-ip>:5500/../../admin`  
  4. Monitor the proxy target (for example, using a logging proxy or a test service) to see if the manipulated URL is forwarded to an unintended internal endpoint.  
  5. If the internal resource is accessed, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Lack of Authentication and Access Control in Externally Accessible Server  
  **Description:**  
  The live server extension is designed as a single–click development server with no built–in authentication or access control mechanisms. Although by default it binds to “127.0.0.1” (thereby preventing external access), a user may inadvertently or intentionally reconfigure the server (by setting “liveServer.settings.useLocalIp” to true or modifying “liveServer.settings.host”) to be accessible from the network. An external attacker, once on the same network, can then access all files served by the live server without any authentication challenge. The attacker’s steps are:  
  1. Identify that the live server is running on a non–localhost interface or a public IP address.  
  2. Connect to the live server’s IP and port using a web browser, curl, or other HTTP client.  
  3. Browse or query for resources, as there is no login, API key, or access–control check in place.  
  
  **Impact:**  
  Without any access control, sensitive development files or configuration details hosted by the live server could be read by unauthorized parties. Additionally, if the live server injects dynamic scripts (for live reload or debugging), an attacker might attempt to manipulate that behavior. This increases the risk of data exfiltration during development misconfigurations.  
  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The default configuration forces the server to bind to “127.0.0.1” with `"liveServer.settings.useLocalIp": false` and `"liveServer.settings.host": "127.0.0.1"`, thereby preventing external access under normal circumstances.  
  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no additional authentication mechanism (such as password protection, token–based authentication, or IP whitelisting) built into the live server.  
  - No warning or hardening is provided when a user chooses to expose the server externally.  
  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The live server must be reconfigured to bind to a network–accessible IP (for example, via `"liveServer.settings.useLocalIp": true` or a modified `"liveServer.settings.host"`).  
  - The attacker must be on the same network (or be able to reach the network) as the misconfigured instance.  
  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  Based on the settings files (and supported features such as remote connection through WLAN as noted in the README), there is no indication of any authentication or session management being implemented. The configuration options and documentation focus solely on convenience (live reload, custom ports, mounting directories) and do not mention any access–control checks. In a typical implementation, the HTTP server is bound to the configured IP and port and immediately serves files based solely on the request URL, with no further verification of the requester’s identity.  
  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Reconfigure the server in a test environment by setting either:
     - `"liveServer.settings.useLocalIp": true`  
       or  
     - `"liveServer.settings.host": "<public-facing-IP>"`
  2. Launch the live server.  
  3. From a separate machine on the same network, access the server using its IP and port.  
  4. Verify that you can view all served content (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) without any authentication challenge.  
  5. Confirm that no additional access–control mechanisms are presented.
