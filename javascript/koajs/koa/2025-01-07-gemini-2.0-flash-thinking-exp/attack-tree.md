## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   This represents the overarching goal of exploiting weaknesses within the application's middleware stack.
*   Success can lead to a wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Identify Vulnerable Middleware (Part of High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__identify_vulnerable_middleware__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Low (Information gathering phase)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Low (Passive activity)
*   Attackers analyze the application's `package.json` or code to identify the middleware being used. This information is then used to research known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Trigger Vulnerability (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__trigger_vulnerability__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** High (Can lead to RCE, DoS, data breaches)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   Once a vulnerability is identified, the attacker crafts specific requests or payloads to trigger the flaw in the vulnerable middleware.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Bypass Security Middleware (Part of High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/4__bypass_security_middleware__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

*   This involves circumventing middleware intended to provide security controls.

    *   **Exploit Logic Flaws in Middleware Ordering:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Circumvent security controls)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   Attackers exploit the order in which middleware is executed to bypass security checks.

    *   **Manipulate Request to Avoid Middleware Execution:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Circumvent security controls)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   Attackers craft requests in a way that causes security middleware to not be executed based on its conditional logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Error Handling Weaknesses (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_error_handling_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

*   This focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles errors.

    *   **Trigger Unhandled Exceptions (Part of High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Low to Medium (DoS, potential information disclosure)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
        *   Attackers send unexpected or malformed input to cause the application to throw unhandled exceptions.

    *   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages (Part of High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Exposure of sensitive data)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   Attackers intentionally trigger error conditions to reveal sensitive information in the error messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Body Parsing Issues (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_body_parsing_issues__critical_node_.md)

*   This involves exploiting vulnerabilities related to how the application parses request bodies.

    *   **Denial of Service via Payload Bomb (Part of High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Temporary service disruption)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
        *   Attackers send extremely large or complex request bodies to overwhelm the server's resources during parsing.

    *   **Vulnerabilities in Body Parser Middleware (e.g., `koa-bodyparser`) (Critical Node):**
        *   This highlights the risk associated with using third-party body parser middleware.

            *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Used Body Parser (Part of High-Risk Path):**
                *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
                *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to RCE, DoS)
                *   **Effort:** Medium to High
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific body parser middleware being used by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Cookie Manipulation (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/7__cookie_manipulation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Account takeover, privilege escalation)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   Attackers modify cookies stored in their browser to attempt to gain unauthorized access or elevate their privileges within the application. This is particularly effective if server-side validation of cookie integrity is weak.
