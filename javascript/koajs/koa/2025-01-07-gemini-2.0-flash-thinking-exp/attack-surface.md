# Attack Surface Analysis for koajs/koa

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious data into HTTP headers, leading to vulnerabilities like HTTP response splitting, cross-site scripting (XSS), or cache poisoning.
*   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa provides direct access to request headers via `ctx.request.header` and allows setting response headers using `ctx.set()` and `ctx.append()`. This direct access, without enforced sanitization, creates the injection point.
*   **Impact:**  Redirection to malicious sites, execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, cache poisoning affecting other users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths provided by users to access files or directories outside of the intended scope on the server.
*   **How Koa Contributes:** If `ctx.request.path` or parameters derived from it are used directly within file system operations without proper validation and sanitization, Koa provides the means for this vulnerability to occur.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, potential execution of arbitrary code if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Ordering Issues](./attack_surfaces/middleware_ordering_issues.md)

*   **Description:** The order in which middleware is added to the Koa application significantly impacts how requests are processed. Incorrect ordering can lead to security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa's core middleware pipeline, managed by `app.use()`, dictates the execution order. This inherent design characteristic means incorrect ordering directly leads to exploitable conditions.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization, exposure of sensitive data, unintended application behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cookie Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cookie_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly configured cookies can be exploited for session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa provides the `ctx.cookies.set()` method for setting cookies. The framework's direct API for cookie manipulation places the responsibility of setting secure flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) on the developer.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource-Intensive Middleware](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource-intensive_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious actors can craft requests that force resource-intensive operations within specific middleware, leading to service disruption.
*   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa's middleware architecture allows for the integration of custom or third-party middleware. If such middleware has performance issues or lacks proper safeguards, Koa's request handling can be leveraged to trigger these resource-intensive operations.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
