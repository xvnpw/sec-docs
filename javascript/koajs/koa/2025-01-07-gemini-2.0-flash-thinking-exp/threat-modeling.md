# Threat Model Analysis for koajs/koa

## Threat: [Malicious Middleware Injection](./threats/malicious_middleware_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains the ability to introduce a malicious middleware component into the Koa application's middleware stack. This could happen through compromised dependencies, insecure package management practices, or vulnerabilities in the deployment process. The attacker's middleware can then directly leverage Koa's request/response handling and context (`ctx`) to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, or exfiltrate sensitive data accessed through Koa's APIs.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, including data breaches, service disruption, and potential takeover of the underlying server.

**Affected Koa Component:** `app.use()` (for adding middleware), the entire middleware stack execution flow orchestrated by Koa.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong dependency management practices, including using lock files and verifying package integrity.
* Regularly audit and review all middleware dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* Secure the deployment pipeline to prevent unauthorized modification of the application code.
* Implement code signing or other integrity checks for middleware components.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Middleware Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_middleware_exploitation.md)

**Description:** The application uses a third-party Koa middleware component that contains a security vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific requests or providing malicious input that is processed by the vulnerable middleware within the Koa request lifecycle. This could lead to various outcomes, such as remote code execution by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the middleware interacts with Koa's request or response objects.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to complete system compromise.

**Affected Koa Component:** The specific vulnerable middleware module, and Koa's core request/response handling that the middleware interacts with.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update all middleware dependencies to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories for commonly used middleware libraries.
* Perform security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in middleware components.
* Consider using alternative, more secure middleware options if vulnerabilities are discovered and not promptly patched.

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Bypass](./threats/middleware_ordering_bypass.md)

**Description:** Due to incorrect ordering of middleware in the Koa application, an attacker can bypass security controls implemented in earlier middleware. This directly leverages Koa's middleware execution order. For example, authentication middleware placed after a route handler could allow unauthorized access to protected resources handled by Koa's routing mechanisms.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Koa Component:** `app.use()` (middleware ordering), the middleware execution flow managed by Koa.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully plan and document the order of middleware execution.
* Enforce a consistent and logical middleware order across the application.
* Use linters or static analysis tools to detect potential middleware ordering issues.
* Thoroughly test the application with different request scenarios to ensure middleware is executed as expected.

## Threat: [Context (`ctx`) Property Manipulation](./threats/context___ctx___property_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Koa itself or its middleware could allow an attacker to manipulate properties of the `ctx` object in unexpected ways. This directly exploits Koa's central context object. This could involve modifying request data accessed through `ctx.request`, response headers set via `ctx.response`, or application state stored in `ctx.state`, potentially leading to security bypasses or unexpected behavior within the Koa application flow.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access, or application malfunction.

**Affected Koa Component:** The `ctx` object, which is a core part of Koa's request handling.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the manipulated property and its usage)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly assigning arbitrary user-controlled data to `ctx` properties used for security-sensitive decisions.
* Implement input validation and sanitization for data accessed through `ctx`.
* Regularly audit middleware for potential vulnerabilities that could lead to `ctx` manipulation.

## Threat: [Insecure Response Header Handling](./threats/insecure_response_header_handling.md)

**Description:** The application, using Koa's `ctx.set()` or other response manipulation methods, incorrectly sets or manipulates response headers, leading to security vulnerabilities. For example, missing `Strict-Transport-Security` or insecure `Content-Security-Policy` headers can expose users to man-in-the-middle attacks or cross-site scripting. This directly involves Koa's API for controlling response headers.

**Impact:** Exposure to various web-based attacks like XSS, clickjacking, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Affected Koa Component:** `ctx.set()` and other methods provided by Koa for setting response headers.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the affected header)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure defaults for common security-related headers.
* Implement middleware to enforce secure header policies.
* Regularly review and test response headers to ensure they are configured correctly.
* Utilize tools like securityheaders.com to analyze the application's headers.
