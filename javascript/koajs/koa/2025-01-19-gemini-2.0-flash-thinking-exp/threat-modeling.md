# Threat Model Analysis for koajs/koa

## Threat: [Middleware Execution Order Exploitation](./threats/middleware_execution_order_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker might leverage the order in which middleware is registered using `app.use()` to bypass security checks or manipulate application logic. By carefully crafting requests, they can exploit situations where a security middleware is executed after a vulnerable processing middleware, effectively negating the security measures.

**Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization, data manipulation, potential for further exploitation depending on the bypassed logic.

**Affected Koa Component:** The `app.use()` method and the order of middleware registration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully plan and document the intended middleware execution order.
* Implement a layered security approach, ensuring multiple middleware components contribute to security.
* Thoroughly test different request scenarios to verify the correct execution order and effectiveness of security checks.
* Use descriptive naming conventions for middleware to indicate their purpose and expected position in the chain.

## Threat: [Context (`ctx`) Object Manipulation Leading to Security Bypass](./threats/context___ctx___object_manipulation_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

**Description:** Koa's central `ctx` object carries request and response information and is passed through the middleware chain. If application logic relies on properties of the `ctx` object (e.g., `ctx.user`, `ctx.isAuthenticated`) set by earlier middleware, a vulnerability in a preceding middleware could allow an attacker to manipulate these properties. This could lead to bypassing authentication or authorization checks if a later middleware incorrectly trusts the manipulated `ctx` state.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation, data manipulation.

**Affected Koa Component:** The `ctx` object and its properties, accessible within all middleware and routes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Minimize the reliance on mutable state within the `ctx` object for security decisions.
* Implement validation and integrity checks on critical `ctx` properties before making security-sensitive decisions.
* Use immutable data structures or cloning when passing sensitive information through the middleware chain to prevent unintended modifications.
* Ensure middleware responsible for setting security-related `ctx` properties are robust and secure.
