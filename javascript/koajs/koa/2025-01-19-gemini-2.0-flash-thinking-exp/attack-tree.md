## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Header Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_header_injection__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request containing newline characters (`\r\n` or `%0D%0A`) within the header values. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary headers or even a full HTTP response after the intended headers.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **HTTP Response Splitting:** The attacker can inject a crafted HTTP response, potentially redirecting the user to a malicious site or serving them malicious content.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting headers like `Set-Cookie` or manipulating content types, the attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser.
    * **Cache Poisoning:** The attacker can manipulate cached responses, affecting other users who access the same resource.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in file upload handling (if used with Koa middleware) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_file_upload_handling__if_used_with_koa_middleware___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the Koa application uses middleware for handling file uploads (e.g., `koa-multer`), vulnerabilities in this middleware or its configuration can be exploited. This can involve bypassing file type checks, uploading files to unintended locations, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying file processing libraries.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Arbitrary File Upload:** The attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, executable code) to the server.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the uploaded file is executable and the server attempts to process it, the attacker can gain control of the server.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading excessively large files can exhaust server resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Koa applications rely heavily on middleware. If any of the used middleware packages have known security vulnerabilities (documented in CVEs or security advisories), an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities. This requires identifying the specific middleware used by the application and researching known flaws.
* **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the middleware. It can range from:
    * **Information Disclosure:** Leaking sensitive data.
    * **Authentication Bypass:** Gaining unauthorized access.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Taking control of the server.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable Koa Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_koa_middleware__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Koa applications rely heavily on middleware. If any of the used middleware packages have known security vulnerabilities (documented in CVEs or security advisories), an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities. This requires identifying the specific middleware used by the application and researching known flaws.
* **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the middleware. It can range from:
    * **Information Disclosure:** Leaking sensitive data.
    * **Authentication Bypass:** Gaining unauthorized access.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Taking control of the server.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Koa's Dependency on Node.js [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_koa's_dependency_on_node_js__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Koa.js runs on the Node.js runtime. Vulnerabilities in the underlying Node.js environment can be exploited through the Koa application's request handling or API usage. This is less about Koa itself and more about the environment it runs in.
* **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the specific Node.js vulnerability. Common examples include:
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Node.js core modules.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the Node.js process.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive data through Node.js APIs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Node.js Specific Vulnerabilities Exposed Through Koa [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_node_js_specific_vulnerabilities_exposed_through_koa__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Koa.js runs on the Node.js runtime. Vulnerabilities in the underlying Node.js environment can be exploited through the Koa application's request handling or API usage. This is less about Koa itself and more about the environment it runs in.
* **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the specific Node.js vulnerability. Common examples include:

    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the Node.js process.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive data through Node.js APIs.
