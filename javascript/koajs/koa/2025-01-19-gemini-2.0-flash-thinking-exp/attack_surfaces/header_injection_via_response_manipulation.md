### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Header Injection via Response Manipulation

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Details

The core of this vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to inject arbitrary characters, specifically carriage return (`\r`) and line feed (`\n`), into HTTP response headers. These characters are used to delimit headers in the HTTP protocol. By injecting these characters, an attacker can effectively terminate the current header and inject new, malicious headers.

**How Koa.js Facilitates the Vulnerability:**

Koa.js provides developers with convenient methods like `ctx.set(field, value)` and `ctx.append(field, value)` to manipulate response headers. While these methods are essential for building dynamic web applications, they become a potential attack vector when the `value` parameter is directly derived from user-controlled input without proper sanitization.

**Example Breakdown:**

The provided example, `ctx.set('Custom-Header', ctx.query.evilInput)`, clearly illustrates the vulnerability. If the `evilInput` query parameter contains characters like `\r\n`, the `ctx.set()` method will blindly set the header with this malicious input.

**Consequences of Malicious Input:**

When the server sends the response with the injected `\r\n`, the client (browser or other HTTP client) interprets this as the end of the `Custom-Header`. Any characters following the `\r\n` are then treated as the start of a new header or even the response body.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Attackers can leverage various input sources to inject malicious headers:

*   **Query Parameters:** As demonstrated in the example, query parameters are a common and easily manipulated input source.
*   **Request Body (POST Data):** If the application processes data from the request body and uses it to set headers, this can also be an injection point.
*   **Path Parameters:** In some cases, path parameters might be used to dynamically generate header values.
*   **Cookies:** While less common for direct header setting, if cookie values are used to influence header output, they could be a vector.

**HTTP Response Splitting:**

The primary consequence of successful header injection is **HTTP Response Splitting**. This allows an attacker to:

1. **Inject Arbitrary Headers:**  The attacker can inject any valid HTTP header, potentially controlling caching behavior, setting malicious cookies, or even redirecting the user.
2. **Inject a Malicious Body:** By injecting a `Content-Length` header and then providing content after the injected headers, the attacker can effectively inject their own HTML or JavaScript content into the response.

**Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

While not a direct consequence of all header injection attacks, HTTP response splitting can be leveraged to achieve XSS in specific scenarios. If the attacker can inject a full HTTP response, including the body, they can inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed by the victim's browser. This typically requires the attacker to control the request path or have some influence over the subsequent request made by the browser.

**Example Scenario of HTTP Response Splitting leading to potential XSS:**

1. An attacker crafts a URL like: `https://example.com/vulnerable?evilInput=%0d%0aContent-Length%3a%2015%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
2. The vulnerable Koa.js application uses `ctx.set('Vulnerable-Header', ctx.query.evilInput)`.
3. The server sends a response similar to:
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Vulnerable-Header: \r\nContent-Length: 15\r\n\r\n<script>alert('XSS')</script>
    ...rest of the original headers...
    ```
4. The browser might interpret the injected content as a separate, malicious response, potentially executing the injected JavaScript.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful header injection attack can range from minor annoyance to critical security breaches:

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** This is the immediate and most direct impact. It allows attackers to manipulate the browser's interpretation of the response.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers can inject headers that cause the response to be cached with malicious content, affecting other users who access the same resource.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** As described above, in specific scenarios, header injection can lead to XSS, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers might be able to inject headers that manipulate cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
*   **Defacement:** By injecting malicious HTML content, attackers can deface web pages.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In some cases, attackers might be able to inject headers that reveal sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:**

As indicated in the initial description, the risk severity of header injection is **High**. The potential for significant security impact, including XSS, makes this a critical vulnerability to address.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

Preventing header injection requires careful attention to how response headers are set and ensuring that user-controlled input is never directly used without proper sanitization. Here are specific mitigation strategies for Koa.js applications:

1. **Avoid Direct Use of User-Controlled Input:** The most effective mitigation is to avoid directly using user-provided data to set response headers. If possible, use predefined, safe header values.

2. **Sanitize and Validate Input:** If user input must be used in headers, rigorously sanitize and validate it. This includes:
    *   **Removing Control Characters:**  Strip out carriage return (`\r`) and line feed (`\n`) characters.
    *   **Whitelisting:**  If possible, only allow specific, known-good characters or patterns in header values.
    *   **Encoding:**  Consider encoding special characters, although this might not always be sufficient to prevent all forms of injection.

3. **Use Secure Header Setting Practices:**
    *   **Libraries for Complex Headers:** For complex headers like `Content-Security-Policy` or `Set-Cookie`, consider using dedicated libraries that handle proper formatting and escaping.
    *   **Be Aware of Injection Points:**  Thoroughly review all code sections where `ctx.set()` or `ctx.append()` are used, especially when the values are derived from user input.

4. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy. While CSP doesn't directly prevent header injection, it can significantly mitigate the impact of XSS if an attacker manages to inject malicious content.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential header injection vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools to help detect these issues.

6. **Framework Updates:** Keep Koa.js and its dependencies up to date. While Koa.js itself is unlikely to have inherent header injection vulnerabilities, updates often include security fixes for underlying libraries.

7. **Input Validation Middleware:** Consider using middleware that can help sanitize and validate incoming request data before it reaches your application logic.

**Example of Vulnerable Code (as provided):**

```javascript
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = new Koa();

app.use(ctx => {
  const evilInput = ctx.query.evilInput;
  if (evilInput) {
    ctx.set('Custom-Header', evilInput); // Vulnerable line
    ctx.body = 'Header set!';
  } else {
    ctx.body = 'No header set.';
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Example of Secure Code:**

```javascript
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = new Koa();

app.use(ctx => {
  const userInput = ctx.query.userInput;
  if (userInput) {
    // Sanitize the input by removing control characters
    const sanitizedInput = userInput.replace(/[\r\n]/g, '');
    ctx.set('Custom-Header', sanitizedInput);
    ctx.body = 'Header set!';
  } else {
    ctx.body = 'No header set.';
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

This secure example demonstrates a basic sanitization technique by removing carriage return and line feed characters. More robust validation and sanitization might be necessary depending on the specific use case and expected input.

### 5. Conclusion

Header injection via response manipulation is a significant security risk in Koa.js applications. By understanding how Koa's header setting mechanisms can be exploited and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can effectively prevent this vulnerability. Prioritizing secure coding practices, input validation, and regular security assessments are crucial for building resilient and secure Koa.js applications.
