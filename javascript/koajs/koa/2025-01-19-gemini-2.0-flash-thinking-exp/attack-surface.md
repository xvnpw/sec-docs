# Attack Surface Analysis for koajs/koa

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/request_body_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in how the application parses and handles the request body can lead to various attacks, including denial-of-service or potential remote code execution.
    *   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa's design relies on external middleware like `koa-bodyparser` for request body processing. The choice and configuration of this middleware directly determine the application's vulnerability to body parsing issues. Koa's flexibility necessitates developers actively choose and secure this component.
    *   **Example:** Using a vulnerable version of `koa-bodyparser` susceptible to a buffer overflow when processing excessively large JSON payloads.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution if the parser has severe vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use well-maintained and regularly updated body parsing middleware.
        *   Configure body parsing middleware with appropriate limits for payload size.
        *   Sanitize and validate data received from the request body.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection via Response Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/header_injection_via_response_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious headers into the HTTP response, potentially leading to HTTP response splitting or other browser-based attacks.
    *   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa provides the `ctx.set()` and `ctx.append()` methods for setting response headers. If developer-controlled input is directly used in these methods without proper sanitization, it can lead to header injection. Koa's direct access to header manipulation makes this a potential risk if not handled carefully.
    *   **Example:**  `ctx.set('Custom-Header', ctx.query.evilInput)` where `evilInput` contains characters like `\r\n`.
    *   **Impact:** HTTP response splitting, potential cross-site scripting (in specific scenarios).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly using user-controlled input to set response headers.
        *   Sanitize and validate any user-provided data before setting it as a header value.
        *   Use secure header setting practices and be aware of potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Middleware Ordering](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_middleware_ordering.md)

*   **Description:** The order in which middleware is applied in Koa is crucial. Incorrect ordering can lead to security middleware being bypassed or unexpected behavior that introduces vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa's middleware pipeline executes in the order defined by `app.use()`. This explicit control over middleware order is powerful but requires careful planning to ensure security middleware is applied correctly.
    *   **Example:** Placing a logging middleware before an authentication middleware, potentially logging sensitive information for unauthenticated requests.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan the order of middleware execution, ensuring security middleware is applied early in the pipeline.
        *   Document the intended middleware order and its security implications.
        *   Test different request scenarios to verify the correct execution flow of middleware.
