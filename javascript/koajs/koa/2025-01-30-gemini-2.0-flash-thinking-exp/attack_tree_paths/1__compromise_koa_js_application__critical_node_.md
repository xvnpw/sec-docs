* **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to user accounts, administrative privileges, sensitive data, and application functionality.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Strong Authentication Mechanisms:** Implement strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and secure password storage (hashing and salting).
    * **Secure Session Management:** Use secure session management practices, including HTTP-only and secure cookies, session timeouts, and proper session invalidation.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to enforce granular access control based on user roles and permissions.
