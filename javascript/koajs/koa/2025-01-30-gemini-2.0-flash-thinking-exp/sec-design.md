# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Koa.js is designed to be a lightweight and flexible web framework for Node.js.
 - It aims to provide a more streamlined and expressive foundation for web applications and APIs compared to its predecessor, Express.js.
 - The primary goal is to enhance developer productivity and application performance by offering a smaller, more modern, and middleware-centric architecture.
 - Koa.js prioritizes clean error handling, content negotiation, and a rich set of utilities to simplify common web development tasks.
 - It is intended for building robust, scalable, and maintainable web services.

- Most Important Business Risks:
 - Risk of vulnerabilities in Koa.js core or its middleware ecosystem that could be exploited in applications built with Koa.js.
 - Risk of insecure coding practices by developers using Koa.js, leading to application-level vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, broken authentication).
 - Risk of denial of service attacks against Koa.js applications due to improper resource management or lack of rate limiting.
 - Risk of data breaches if sensitive data is not properly handled or secured within Koa.js applications.
 - Risk of supply chain attacks targeting dependencies used by Koa.js or applications built on it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning is likely performed by developers using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` during development and build processes. (Implemented by developers locally and in CI/CD pipelines).
 - security control: Regular updates to Koa.js and its dependencies are expected to address known vulnerabilities. (Implemented by developers and maintainers).
 - security control: Middleware-based security practices are encouraged, allowing developers to implement security features like authentication, authorization, and input validation as middleware components. (Implemented by developers in application code).
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community-maintained middleware may introduce vulnerabilities if middleware is not actively maintained or securely developed.
 - accepted risk: Security is largely the responsibility of the application developer using Koa.js, as Koa.js itself provides minimal built-in security features beyond basic request handling.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in application code and configurations.
 - security control: Implement Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify runtime vulnerabilities in deployed Koa.js applications.
 - security control: Establish a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of production deployments to protect against common web attacks.
 - security control: Implement rate limiting and request throttling middleware to mitigate denial of service attacks.
 - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Koa.js applications to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users or clients accessing the application.
  - Requirement: Support for various authentication methods such as session-based authentication, token-based authentication (JWT), or OAuth 2.0.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement robust authorization controls to ensure that authenticated users or clients only have access to the resources and actions they are permitted to access.
  - Requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) should be considered for managing permissions.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Implement comprehensive input validation on all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
  - Requirement: Input validation should be performed both on the client-side and server-side.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Use strong cryptography to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
  - Requirement: Implement HTTPS for all communication to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over the network.
  - Requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys and secrets.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Serving user requests and providing application functionality.
 - Data storage and retrieval.
 - User authentication and authorization.
 - API integrations with external services.

- Data Sensitivity:
 - Data sensitivity depends on the specific application built with Koa.js.
 - Could include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, or other sensitive business data.
 - Sensitivity level needs to be determined based on the application's purpose and data it handles.
 - High sensitivity data requires strong protection measures like encryption at rest and in transit, strict access controls, and data loss prevention mechanisms.

 - What is the expected scale and performance requirements of the application?

- Assumptions:
 - The Koa.js application will handle user data and requires security measures to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
 - The application will be deployed in a cloud environment using containers and Kubernetes for scalability and resilience.
 - Security is a high priority for the project, and a proactive approach to security is desired.
 - The development team has some familiarity with secure coding practices and web application security principles.
