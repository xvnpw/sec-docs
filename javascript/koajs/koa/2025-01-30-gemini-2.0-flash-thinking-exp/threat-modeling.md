# Threat Model Analysis for koajs/koa

## Threat: [Malicious Middleware Injection](./threats/malicious_middleware_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a middleware repository or package registry and injects malicious code into a seemingly legitimate middleware package. Developers unknowingly install and use this compromised middleware in their Koa application. The malicious middleware can steal credentials, log sensitive data, or inject backdoors.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full application compromise, data breach, loss of confidentiality and integrity, potential for long-term persistent access for the attacker.
*   **Koa Component Affected:** Middleware ecosystem, `app.use()` function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and audit all middleware dependencies before installation.
    *   Use reputable and actively maintained middleware libraries.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to continuously monitor middleware dependencies.
    *   Use package lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions.
    *   Regularly update middleware dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Middleware Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_middleware_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in a middleware component used by the Koa application and crafts requests to exploit it. This can lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. Potential for remote code execution, data breach, information disclosure, or application downtime.
*   **Koa Component Affected:** Middleware ecosystem, specific vulnerable middleware module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update all middleware dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for used middleware libraries.
    *   Implement vulnerability scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Consider using middleware with strong security track records.
    *   Apply security patches promptly when vulnerabilities are disclosed.

## Threat: [Middleware Chain Bypass](./threats/middleware_chain_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities, an attacker bypasses intended security middleware in the chain. This allows access to protected resources or functionalities without proper security checks.
*   **Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to resources, security controls bypassed, potential for further exploitation.
*   **Koa Component Affected:** Middleware chain, `app.use()` order, middleware logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and document the middleware chain order, ensuring security middleware is placed appropriately.
    *   Thoroughly test the middleware chain to verify the intended execution flow and security middleware execution.
    *   Use middleware composition patterns that clearly define and enforce execution order.
    *   Implement integration tests to check middleware chain execution under various scenarios.

## Threat: [Middleware Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/middleware_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends requests to trigger resource-intensive operations in middleware, exhausting server resources and causing application unresponsiveness or crashes, leading to denial of service.
*   **Impact:** High. Application downtime, service disruption, negative impact on user experience and availability.
*   **Koa Component Affected:** Middleware ecosystem, specific resource-intensive middleware module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Monitor resource usage of middleware components under load.
    *   Implement rate limiting middleware to restrict requests from a single source.
    *   Use request throttling middleware to control the rate of incoming requests.
    *   Optimize middleware for performance and resource efficiency.
    *   Consider asynchronous middleware to prevent blocking the event loop.
    *   Implement load balancing and auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes.

## Threat: [Route Misconfiguration - Unprotected Admin Endpoint](./threats/route_misconfiguration_-_unprotected_admin_endpoint.md)

*   **Description:** Developers fail to apply authentication or authorization middleware to sensitive routes like admin endpoints. This allows unauthorized access to administrative functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. Unauthorized access to administrative functionalities, potential for data breach, system compromise, and full application takeover.
*   **Koa Component Affected:** Routing system, `koa-router` or similar routing middleware, route definitions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and test route configurations, especially for sensitive endpoints.
    *   Implement clear access control and authentication middleware for all sensitive routes.
    *   Use route grouping and prefixing to manage routes and apply middleware consistently.
    *   Regularly audit route configurations to identify and correct misconfigurations.
    *   Implement automated tests to verify access control middleware on protected routes.
