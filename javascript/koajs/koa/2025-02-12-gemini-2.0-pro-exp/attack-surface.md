# Attack Surface Analysis for koajs/koa

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Error Handling Failures](./attack_surfaces/middleware_error_handling_failures.md)

*   **Description:** Uncaught exceptions or unhandled promise rejections within Koa middleware can lead to application crashes, information disclosure, or unexpected behavior.
*   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa's minimalist design *relies entirely* on middleware for error handling.  The framework provides *no* default error handling beyond a basic console log; it's *entirely* the developer's responsibility. This is a core design choice of Koa.
*   **Example:** A middleware that interacts with a database doesn't catch a database connection error, leading to an unhandled promise rejection and application crash.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crashes.
    *   Information disclosure (stack traces, internal error messages) revealing sensitive details.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a global error-handling middleware as the *first* middleware.  `try...catch` around `await next()`.
    *   Log errors securely.
    *   Return appropriate HTTP status codes and *sanitized* error messages. Never expose raw error details.
    *   Ensure *all* promises have `await` or `.catch()`.
    *   Use a dedicated error-handling library if needed.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Ordering Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/middleware_ordering_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect ordering of middleware can bypass security checks.
*   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa's execution flow is *completely* determined by the order of `app.use()`.  This is a fundamental aspect of Koa's design, providing flexibility but also creating this risk.  Koa *does not* provide any built-in mechanisms to enforce or validate middleware order.
*   **Example:** Authentication middleware placed *after* resource access middleware.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Bypass of authentication and authorization.
    *   Incomplete logging.
    *   Exposure of sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully plan and document middleware order. Security middleware *before* business logic.
    *   Use a consistent pattern.
    *   Thoroughly test to ensure correct order and effective security controls.

## Attack Surface: [Trust Proxy Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/trust_proxy_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configuring Koa's `app.proxy` can lead to trusting forged `X-Forwarded-*` headers.
*   **How Koa Contributes:** Koa *provides* the `app.proxy` setting and related header options (`app.proxyIpHeader`, etc.).  The framework *itself* does the header processing based on this configuration.  The vulnerability arises from *misusing* these Koa-provided features.
*   **Example:** `app.proxy = true` without verifying the reverse proxy's trustworthiness.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Bypass of IP-based access control and rate limiting.
    *   Spoofing of client IPs in logs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   `app.proxy = true` *only* if you trust the proxy.
    *   Configure `app.proxyIpHeader`, `app.proxyProtocolHeader` and `app.proxyHostHeader` correctly.
    *   Ensure the reverse proxy is secure.
    *   `app.proxy = false` (default) if not needed.
    *   Validate header values if used for security decisions.

## Attack Surface: [Asynchronous Operation Issues (Unhandled Promise Rejections)](./attack_surfaces/asynchronous_operation_issues__unhandled_promise_rejections_.md)

* **Description:** Failure to handle promise rejections in asynchronous Koa middleware.
    * **How Koa Contributes:** Koa's core is built around asynchronous operations and promises. The framework *relies entirely* on developers to handle rejections. Koa *does not* automatically handle them in a safe way.
    * **Example:** A middleware makes an asynchronous API call but omits a `.catch()`.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Application crashes (DoS).
        *   Resource leaks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure *all* promises have `await` or `.catch()`.
        *   Use a global unhandled rejection handler as a *last resort*. Prioritize proper handling within middleware.
