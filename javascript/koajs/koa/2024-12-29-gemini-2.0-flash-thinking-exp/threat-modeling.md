### High and Critical Koa.js Threats (Directly Involving Koa)

*   **Threat:** Middleware Execution Order Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts requests that exploit the inherent order in which Koa executes middleware. By carefully manipulating the request, they can bypass security checks implemented in earlier middleware stages and reach vulnerable handlers or resources. This directly leverages Koa's core middleware pipeline mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
    *   **Koa Component Affected:** Middleware pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design the middleware pipeline, ensuring security-critical middleware is registered and executed early in the chain.
        *   Avoid relying solely on middleware order for security; implement robust checks within individual middleware functions that are independent of preceding middleware.
        *   Thoroughly test different request scenarios to ensure the middleware pipeline behaves as expected and security checks are consistently enforced.

*   **Threat:** `ctx.state` Information Leakage
    *   **Description:** Developers might store sensitive information within the `ctx.state` object, a core feature of Koa for sharing data between middleware. If not handled with extreme care, this information can be inadvertently exposed in responses, logs, or error messages generated by Koa or its middleware, potentially revealing it to attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially leading to further attacks or compromise.
    *   **Koa Component Affected:** `ctx.state` property.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium  *(Note: While previously marked Medium, the direct involvement of a core Koa feature and potential for significant impact warrants a reassessment. Depending on the sensitivity of the data, this could be High. For this exercise, I'll stick to the previous assessment but acknowledge the potential for escalation.)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the storage of sensitive information in `ctx.state`.
        *   If sensitive data must be stored, ensure it is never directly included in response bodies without explicit and secure handling.
        *   Implement secure logging practices that redact sensitive information from logs generated by Koa or its middleware.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Error Messages
    *   **Description:** Koa's default error handling mechanism, if not customized, can expose sensitive information in error responses. This includes stack traces, internal file paths, and potentially other debugging information that can aid attackers in understanding the application's structure and vulnerabilities. This directly relates to how Koa handles and formats errors.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, aiding attackers in reconnaissance and planning further attacks.
    *   **Koa Component Affected:** Koa's default error handling mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(Similar to `ctx.state`, the direct involvement of a core Koa feature and potential for aiding attacks could elevate this to High in some contexts.)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement custom error handling middleware in Koa to control the information exposed in error responses, especially in production environments.
        *   Log detailed error information securely for debugging purposes, but avoid exposing it to end-users.

*   **Threat:** Unhandled Exception Leading to Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** While applications should handle exceptions, Koa's core functionality is involved in how unhandled exceptions propagate. If middleware or route handlers throw exceptions that are not caught and handled appropriately, Koa can potentially crash the application process, leading to a denial of service. This directly relates to Koa's event loop and error propagation.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability.
    *   **Koa Component Affected:** Koa's core, specifically its event loop and error handling within the request/response cycle.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(Again, the direct impact on availability could justify a High severity in certain scenarios.)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement comprehensive error handling within all middleware and route handlers using `try...catch` blocks.
        *   Utilize Koa's error handling middleware to catch and gracefully handle unexpected exceptions.
        *   Ensure asynchronous operations (Promises) are properly handled to prevent unhandled promise rejections that can lead to crashes.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting to detect application crashes and restarts.
