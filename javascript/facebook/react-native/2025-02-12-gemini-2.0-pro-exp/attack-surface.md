# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/react-native

## Attack Surface: [Bridge Communication Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/bridge_communication_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting the communication channel (the "bridge") between the JavaScript and native layers. This is the core mechanism for React Native operation.
*   **How React Native Contributes:** React Native's fundamental architecture *depends* on this bridge for *all* JavaScript-to-native communication, making it a central and unavoidable attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts and modifies a message containing a serialized authentication token sent across the bridge, gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, application manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the data and exposed native functionality).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Both Sides):** Rigorous validation and sanitization of *all* data crossing the bridge, implemented on *both* the JavaScript and native sides. Use schema validation.
    *   **Message Integrity:** Employ cryptographic techniques (e.g., HMAC) to ensure message integrity, preventing tampering, especially for sensitive operations.
    *   **Minimize Bridge Traffic:** Reduce the volume and frequency of bridge communication.
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Data on Bridge:** Never transmit sensitive data (passwords, API keys) directly. Use secure storage and pass identifiers instead.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks targeting the bridge.

## Attack Surface: [Native Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/native_module_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within native code modules (Objective-C/Swift/Java/Kotlin) accessed *via* the React Native bridge.
*   **How React Native Contributes:** React Native *enables* the creation and integration of custom native modules, directly exposing the application to potential native code vulnerabilities through the bridge.
*   **Example:** A native module handling cryptographic operations has a memory corruption bug. An attacker sends crafted data through the bridge to trigger the bug and gain code execution.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, privilege escalation, data breaches, application crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the native module's privileges and functionality).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Native Code Practices:** Rigorously apply secure coding practices in the native code. Prioritize memory-safe languages (Swift, Kotlin) when possible.
    *   **Native-Side Input Validation:** Validate *all* input received from JavaScript within the native module, *even if* JavaScript-side validation exists (defense in depth).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure native modules have only the absolute minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Auditing and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting native modules.
    *   **Vetted Third-Party Modules:** Thoroughly vet and review the source code of *any* third-party native modules before integration.

## Attack Surface: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Releasing the application with React Native's debugging features enabled, leading to information disclosure or facilitating reverse engineering.
*   **How React Native Contributes:** React Native provides built-in debugging tools (remote debugging, performance monitoring, etc.) that, if not explicitly disabled, can expose sensitive internal details.
*   **Example:** An application is released with remote debugging enabled. An attacker connects to the running application and inspects its memory, potentially extracting API keys or other sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, easier reverse engineering, potential for remote code execution (if remote debugging is fully enabled and exploitable).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicitly Disable Debug Mode:** Ensure debug mode is *explicitly* disabled in release builds. This is a crucial step.
    *   **Automated Build Processes:** Configure build processes to *automatically* disable debug mode for production releases.
    *   **Build Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review and double-check all build settings before releasing the application to ensure debug mode is off.
