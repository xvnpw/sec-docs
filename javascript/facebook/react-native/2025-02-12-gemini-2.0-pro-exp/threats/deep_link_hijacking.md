### 2. Deep Analysis of Deep Link Hijacking

#### 2.1. Threat Mechanism

Deep link hijacking exploits the way mobile operating systems handle URLs intended to open specific applications.  The core issue is the potential for multiple applications to register for the same URL scheme.

*   **Android (Custom URL Schemes - *Legacy and Vulnerable*):**  Applications declare intent filters in their `AndroidManifest.xml` to handle specific URL schemes (e.g., `myapp://`).  If multiple apps register for the same scheme, the OS may present a disambiguation dialog (chooser) to the user, or worse, launch the *wrong* app without any warning (depending on OS version and user settings).  This is the primary vulnerability.

*   **Android (App Links - *Secure*):**  App Links are a special type of intent filter that includes a `android:autoVerify="true"` attribute and requires a Digital Asset Links (DAL) file to be hosted on the associated website.  This file proves ownership of the domain, preventing other apps from claiming the same links.  The OS verifies the DAL file at install time.

*   **iOS (Custom URL Schemes - *Legacy and Vulnerable*):**  Similar to Android's custom schemes, iOS allows apps to register for custom URL schemes (e.g., `myapp://`) in their `Info.plist`.  The OS does *not* enforce uniqueness, leading to potential hijacking.  The *last* installed app claiming a scheme often "wins," but this behavior is not guaranteed.

*   **iOS (Universal Links - *Secure*):**  Universal Links are the preferred method on iOS.  They require an Apple App Site Association (AASA) file to be hosted on the associated website.  This file, similar to Android's DAL, proves domain ownership.  The OS verifies the AASA file when the app is installed.  Importantly, Universal Links *bypass* the custom URL scheme mechanism entirely, providing a direct, secure link to the app.

#### 2.2. Vulnerabilities in React Native

*   **Reliance on Custom URL Schemes (Without App Links/Universal Links):**  The most significant vulnerability is *not* using App Links (Android) or Universal Links (iOS).  If an app only uses custom URL schemes, it is inherently vulnerable to hijacking.

*   **Improper Intent Filter Configuration (Android):**  Even with App Links, incorrect configuration in `AndroidManifest.xml` can create vulnerabilities.  For example:
    *   Missing `android:autoVerify="true"`.
    *   Incorrectly formatted `data` elements (e.g., missing `android:host` or `android:pathPrefix`).
    *   Using overly broad intent filters that capture unintended URLs.

*   **Missing or Incorrect AASA/DAL File:**  If the AASA (iOS) or DAL (Android) file is missing, incorrectly formatted, or not accessible on the associated website, App Links/Universal Links will *fail silently*, falling back to the insecure custom URL scheme.

*   **Insecure Handling of Deep Link Data (JavaScript):**  The React Native JavaScript code that processes incoming deep links (using `Linking.addEventListener`) is a critical point of vulnerability.  Common issues include:
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  Failing to validate and sanitize *all* data received from the deep link.  Attackers can inject malicious data into URL parameters.
    *   **Direct Use of Untrusted Data:**  Using deep link data directly in sensitive operations (e.g., setting user authentication state, displaying data without escaping) without proper sanitization.
    *   **Lack of Contextual Awareness:**  Not verifying the *source* of the deep link (e.g., was it triggered by a user action or potentially by a malicious app?).

#### 2.3. Exploitation Scenarios

*   **Phishing Attack:**
    1.  An attacker creates a malicious app that registers the same custom URL scheme as a legitimate banking app (e.g., `mybank://`).
    2.  The attacker sends a phishing email with a link like `mybank://login?user=victim&redirect=malicious.com`.
    3.  The victim clicks the link.  If the malicious app is installed and the legitimate app only uses custom URL schemes, the OS might launch the malicious app.
    4.  The malicious app mimics the legitimate app's login screen.
    5.  The victim enters their credentials, which are sent to the attacker.

*   **Data Leakage:**
    1.  A legitimate app uses a deep link to share a document: `myapp://viewDocument?docId=123&token=sensitiveToken`.  The `token` is a sensitive session token.
    2.  An attacker's malicious app registers for `myapp://`.
    3.  When the user clicks the legitimate deep link, the malicious app intercepts it and steals the `sensitiveToken`.

*   **Redirection to Malicious Site:**
    1.  A legitimate app uses a deep link for password reset: `myapp://resetPassword?token=resetToken`.
    2.  A malicious app intercepts the link.
    3.  Instead of handling the password reset, the malicious app redirects the user to a phishing site that looks like the legitimate app's website.

#### 2.4. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

*   **Mandatory Use of App Links (Android) and Universal Links (iOS):**
    *   **Android:**
        *   In `AndroidManifest.xml`, use intent filters with `android:autoVerify="true"`.
        *   Create a `assetlinks.json` file (Digital Asset Links) and host it at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.  This file must contain the SHA256 fingerprint of your app's signing key.
        *   Use the Android Studio App Links Assistant to simplify the process.
    *   **iOS:**
        *   In your Xcode project, enable "Associated Domains" and add your domain (e.g., `applinks:yourdomain.com`).
        *   Create an `apple-app-site-association` file (AASA) and host it at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` (and also at the root of your domain, `https://yourdomain.com/apple-app-site-association`).  This file specifies which paths on your domain should be handled as Universal Links.
        *   Use the Apple Developer portal to configure your app's entitlements.
    *   **React Native Configuration:** Use a library like `react-native-app-link` to simplify the configuration and testing of App Links and Universal Links. This library can help generate the necessary files and configurations.

*   **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization (JavaScript):**
    *   Use a dedicated library for URL parsing and validation (e.g., `url-parse`).
    *   Validate *every* parameter received in the deep link against a strict whitelist of expected values.
    *   Sanitize any data that will be displayed to the user or used in sensitive operations (e.g., using a library like `DOMPurify` to prevent XSS).
    *   Consider using a schema validation library (e.g., `joi` or `yup`) to define the expected structure of your deep link data.

    ```javascript
    // Example using url-parse and joi
    import URL from 'url-parse';
    import Joi from 'joi';
    import { Linking } from 'react-native';

    const deepLinkSchema = Joi.object({
      action: Joi.string().valid('viewDocument', 'resetPassword').required(),
      docId: Joi.number().integer().positive().optional(),
      token: Joi.string().alphanum().optional(), // Example: Alphanumeric token
    });

    Linking.addEventListener('url', ({ url }) => {
      const parsedUrl = new URL(url, true); // Parse the URL
      const { pathname, query } = parsedUrl;

      // Construct a data object from the path and query
      const deepLinkData = {
        action: pathname.substring(1), // Remove leading slash
        ...query,
      };

      // Validate the data
      const { error, value } = deepLinkSchema.validate(deepLinkData);

      if (error) {
        console.error('Invalid deep link data:', error);
        // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., show an error message)
        return;
      }

      // Use the validated data (value)
      console.log('Validated deep link data:', value);

      // ... proceed with handling the deep link ...
    });
    ```

*   **Confirmation Prompts (for sensitive actions):**
    *   Before performing *any* action that could compromise user security or data, display a clear confirmation prompt.
    *   The prompt should clearly state the action being performed and the application that is requesting it.
    *   Include a visual indicator (e.g., your app's icon) to help the user verify the app's identity.

    ```javascript
    // Example confirmation prompt
    import { Alert } from 'react-native';

    function handleSensitiveAction(data) {
      Alert.alert(
        'Confirm Action',
        `MyApp is requesting to ${data.action} with ID ${data.docId}.  Do you want to proceed?`,
        [
          { text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel' },
          { text: 'OK', onPress: () => { /* ... proceed with the action ... */ } },
        ],
        { cancelable: false }
      );
    }
    ```

*   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Deep Links:**
    *   *Never* include sensitive data (passwords, session tokens, PII) directly in deep link parameters.
    *   Instead, use a one-time token or a short-lived, randomly generated identifier.
    *   After the app is launched and verified (using App Links/Universal Links), exchange this token for a session token using a secure API call (over HTTPS).

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of your deep linking implementation.
    *   Perform penetration testing to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities.

#### 2.5. Testing and Verification

*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for your deep link handling code to ensure that input validation and sanitization are working correctly.

*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire deep linking flow, from clicking a link to handling the data in your app.

*   **Android App Links Verification:**
    *   Use the `adb` command-line tool: `adb shell pm get-app-links <your.package.name>`.  This should show the status of your App Links verification.
    *   Use the Digital Asset Links API: `https://digitalassetlinks.googleapis.com/v1/statements:list?source.web.site=<yourdomain.com>&relation=delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls`.  This should return a statement confirming that your app is authorized to handle links for your domain.

*   **iOS Universal Links Verification:**
    *   Use the Apple App Site Association validator: `https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator/`.
    *   Test on a real device.  Universal Links do *not* work on the iOS Simulator.  Long-press a link to your domain in an email or note; it should show "Open in [Your App Name]" if Universal Links are working correctly.

*   **Manual Testing:**  Manually test various deep link scenarios, including:
    *   Links with valid and invalid parameters.
    *   Links that trigger sensitive actions.
    *   Links from different sources (email, SMS, web browser).

* **Attempt Hijacking:** Create a simple "malicious" app that registers the same custom URL scheme (if you are testing without App Links/Universal Links) and verify that it *cannot* intercept your app's deep links when App Links/Universal Links are properly configured.

This comprehensive analysis provides a strong foundation for securing React Native applications against Deep Link Hijacking. By implementing these mitigations and following the testing guidelines, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this serious vulnerability.
