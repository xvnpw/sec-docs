## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit React Native Bridge Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_react_native_bridge_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Critical Node: `[***Insecure Data Transfer***]`**
    *   **Description:**  The React Native bridge is the communication channel between the JavaScript code and the native (iOS/Android) code.  If data transmitted across this bridge is not properly secured, it becomes a prime target for attackers.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Lack of Encryption:**
            *   **Description:** Sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, API keys, personal information) is sent across the bridge without encryption.
            *   **How it works:** An attacker uses network sniffing tools (e.g., Wireshark) to intercept the unencrypted traffic between the app and the server, or between the JavaScript and native layers of the app.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake)
            *   **Impact:** High (Data breach)
            *   **Effort:** Low (Easy to intercept unencrypted traffic)
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires network monitoring)

*   **Critical Node: `[***JS-Native Code Injection***]`**
    *   **Description:** This is the most critical vulnerability.  It allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's context, potentially leading to complete control over the app's behavior and access to sensitive data.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **`---(HIGH RISK)---` `[***JS Code Injection***]`:**
            *   **Description:** User-supplied data, or data from an untrusted source, is passed directly to a native module function without proper sanitization or validation.  This allows the attacker to craft malicious input that, when processed by the native module, executes arbitrary JavaScript code.
            *   **How it works:**
                1.  The attacker identifies an input field or a data source that is passed to a native module.
                2.  The attacker crafts a malicious payload (JavaScript code) disguised as normal input.
                3.  The app passes this payload to the native module.
                4.  The native module, lacking proper input validation, executes the injected JavaScript code.
                5.  The injected code can then access sensitive data, modify the UI, or interact with other native features.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common vulnerability if input isn't sanitized)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Arbitrary code execution)
            *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding an injection point)
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected through code analysis or runtime monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit React Native Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_react_native_component_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Critical Node: `[Vulnerable 3rd-Party React Native Libs]`**
    *   **Description:** React Native applications often rely on numerous third-party libraries.  These libraries can contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **`---(HIGH RISK)---` `[***Outdated Libs***]`:**
            *   **Description:** The application uses a version of a third-party library that has a known, publicly disclosed vulnerability.
            *   **How it works:**
                1.  An attacker uses automated tools or manual analysis to identify the versions of third-party libraries used by the app.
                2.  The attacker checks public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, Snyk, npm advisories) for known vulnerabilities in those library versions.
                3.  If a known vulnerability exists, the attacker uses a publicly available exploit or crafts their own exploit based on the vulnerability details.
                4.  The attacker exploits the vulnerability to gain access to the app, exfiltrate data, or execute arbitrary code.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (Very common, especially in larger projects)
            *   **Impact:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability, can range from Low to Very High)
            *   **Effort:** Low (Automated tools can find outdated libraries)
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Automated tools can detect outdated libraries)
