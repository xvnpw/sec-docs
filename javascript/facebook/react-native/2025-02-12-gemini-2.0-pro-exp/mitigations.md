## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `WebView` Usage (React Native Component)](./mitigation_strategies/secure__webview__usage__react_native_component_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `WebView` Configuration and Communication

1.  **Minimize `WebView` Use:** If possible, avoid using the React Native `WebView` component altogether. Consider using native components or libraries designed for secure rendering of external content. This is the *best* mitigation, as `WebView` introduces a large attack surface.
2.  **`originWhitelist` (React Native Prop):** If `WebView` is *necessary*, use the `originWhitelist` prop *provided by React Native* to restrict which origins can be loaded. Only allow trusted domains. Example: `originWhitelist={['https://www.example.com']}`. This is a React Native-specific control.
3.  **Avoid `injectJavaScript` (React Native API):** Minimize the use of the `injectJavaScript` prop *of the React Native `WebView`*. If you must use it, ensure the injected code is:
    *   Extremely minimal.
    *   Thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Does not handle any sensitive data.
4.  **`postMessage` for Communication (React Native API):** Use `postMessage` (from the injected JavaScript) and the `onMessage` prop (on the React Native `WebView` component) for communication between the `WebView` and React Native. This is a more secure way to exchange data than direct JavaScript injection, and it's facilitated by React Native's API.
5.  **Validate Messages (React Native Side):** Thoroughly validate all messages received from the `WebView` via the `onMessage` event handler *in your React Native code*. Treat these messages as untrusted input. This is crucial for securing the React Native side of the communication.
6.  **Disable JavaScript (If Possible - React Native Prop):** If the `WebView` content does not require JavaScript, disable it using the `javaScriptEnabled` prop of the React Native `WebView` (set to `false`). This significantly reduces the attack surface.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Limits the ability of attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `WebView` and, crucially, prevents those scripts from interacting with the React Native application in unintended ways.
*   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers injecting arbitrary code through the `WebView` that could then interact with the React Native bridge.
*   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):** Limits the ability of malicious code within the `WebView` to access sensitive data in the React Native application via the bridge.
*   **Phishing (Medium Severity):** Makes it more difficult for attackers to load phishing pages within the `WebView` and trick users into providing credentials that could be sent to the React Native side.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk, especially when combined with CSP (though CSP itself isn't React Native-specific).
*   **Code Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Phishing:** Reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `originWhitelist` is used in `src/components/HelpScreen.js` to restrict the `WebView` to the official documentation website.
*   `postMessage` is used for communication in `src/components/HelpScreen.js`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Message validation is basic and needs to be strengthened in `src/components/HelpScreen.js`. A more robust schema should be used, specifically within the React Native `onMessage` handler.
*   `javaScriptEnabled` is not explicitly set to `false` where possible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Storage of Sensitive Data (Using React Native Libraries)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_storage_of_sensitive_data__using_react_native_libraries_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use Native Secure Storage APIs via React Native Libraries

1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Identify all sensitive data.
2.  **Choose a Secure Storage *React Native* Library:** Select a *React Native* library that provides access to platform-specific secure storage mechanisms.  This is the key React Native-specific part:
    *   **Examples:** `react-native-keychain`, `react-native-sensitive-info`. These libraries bridge the gap to native secure storage.
3.  **Implement Secure Storage (Using the Library):** Use the chosen *React Native* library to store and retrieve sensitive data. Follow the library's documentation carefully.  The library handles the interaction with the native APIs.
4.  **Data Minimization:** Only store the minimum amount of sensitive data required. Delete data when it is no longer needed.
5.  **Access Control:** Implement appropriate access controls within your *React Native* code to ensure that only authorized parts of your application can access the stored data (using the library's API).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data from being accessed, even if the device is compromised, by leveraging native secure storage *through the React Native library*.
*   **Reverse Engineering (Medium Severity):** Makes it more difficult for attackers to extract sensitive data by reverse engineering the *React Native* application, as the data is not stored in plain text within the JavaScript bundle.
*   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Even if an attacker injects code into the *React Native* JavaScript environment, they won't be able to directly access data stored in secure storage (accessed via the native bridge).

**Impact:**
*   **Data Breach:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Reverse Engineering:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Code Injection:** Reduces the impact of code injection.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `react-native-keychain` is used to store authentication tokens in `src/services/AuthService.js`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No secure storage is used for user preferences that might contain PII (e.g., location data).  A React Native secure storage library needs to be used here.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deep Link Handling (React Native Navigation and Linking)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deep_link_handling__react_native_navigation_and_linking_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Validate and Restrict Deep Link Actions using React Native APIs

1.  **Identify Deep Link Schemes:** Identify all deep link schemes your application handles, as configured for your React Native project.
2.  **Validate Deep Link URLs (React Native Side):** Implement strict validation for all deep link URLs received by your application *using React Native's Linking API*. This validation should happen within your React Native code. Check:
    *   **Scheme:** Ensure the scheme matches your expected schemes.
    *   **Host:** Ensure the host is valid (if applicable).
    *   **Path:** Validate the path and ensure it conforms to expected patterns.
    *   **Query Parameters:** Validate all query parameters, including their types, formats, and values.  This is all done within the React Native `Linking.addEventListener` handler.
3.  **Avoid Sensitive Actions:** Do not perform sensitive actions directly from deep links without additional authentication or confirmation *within your React Native application*.
4. **App Links (Android) and Universal Links (iOS):** While the configuration of these is platform-specific, the *handling* of the resulting links is done within React Native, typically using the `Linking` API.
5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test your deep link handling *within your React Native application*, including edge cases and invalid URLs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Deep Link Hijacking (Medium Severity):** Prevents other applications from intercepting and handling your application's deep links (especially when combined with App Links/Universal Links).
*   **Unauthorized Actions (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from using deep links to trigger unauthorized actions within your *React Native* application.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers using deep links to extract sensitive data from your *React Native* application.
*   **Phishing (Medium Severity):** Makes it more difficult to use deep links for phishing attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Deep Link Hijacking:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Reduces the risk.
*   **Phishing:** Reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic deep link handling is implemented in `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js` using React Native's `Linking` API.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Deep link URLs are not thoroughly validated *within the React Native code*. Strict validation rules need to be added to the `Linking.addEventListener` handler.
*   Sensitive actions (like password reset) can be triggered via deep links without additional authentication *within the React Native app*. This needs to be changed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Bridge Communication (JavaScript to Native and Vice-Versa)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_bridge_communication__javascript_to_native_and_vice-versa_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Validation and Type Checking for Bridge Communication

1.  **Identify Bridge Communication Points:**  List all points where data is passed between JavaScript and native code using the React Native bridge. This includes:
    *   Calls to native modules from JavaScript.
    *   Events emitted from native modules to JavaScript.
    *   Any custom bridging mechanisms.
2.  **Define a Schema:**  Create a well-defined schema for *all* data passed across the bridge.  This schema should specify:
    *   The expected data types (string, number, boolean, array, object).
    *   The structure of objects (required properties, allowed values).
    *   Any constraints on the data (e.g., minimum/maximum lengths, regular expressions).
3.  **Implement Validation (JavaScript Side):**  Before sending data to a native module, validate it against the defined schema *in your React Native JavaScript code*.
4.  **Implement Validation (Native Side):**  When receiving data from JavaScript, validate it against the defined schema *in your native code (Objective-C/Swift or Java/Kotlin)*.  Do *not* assume the JavaScript side has performed validation.
5.  **Type Checking:**  Use strict type checking on both sides of the bridge.  Avoid using dynamic types or `any` types where possible.
6.  **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling for bridge communication.  If validation fails, return a clear error message to the other side of the bridge.
7. **Serialization:** Use a well-defined serialization format like JSON for bridge communication.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Bridge Injection (High Severity):**  Prevents malicious data from being passed from JavaScript to native code (or vice-versa), potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in native components or causing crashes. This is *specific* to the React Native bridge.
*   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):**  Prevents invalid or unexpected data from corrupting application state on either side of the bridge.
*   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of code injection vulnerabilities that could be triggered by passing malicious data to native code.

**Impact:**
*   **Bridge Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Data Corruption:** Reduces the risk.
*   **Code Injection:** Reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic type checking is performed in `src/nativeModules/MyNativeModule.js` (JavaScript side) before calling native methods.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A formal schema for bridge communication is not defined.  This needs to be created.
*   Validation is not consistently implemented on the *native* side (in the corresponding Objective-C/Java code). This is a critical gap.
*   Robust error handling for bridge communication is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure OTA Updates (Using React Native Specific Services)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ota_updates__using_react_native_specific_services_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure OTA Update Mechanism with Code Signing (using React Native-focused services)

1.  **Choose a Secure OTA *React Native* Service:** If using an OTA update service, choose one that is specifically designed for React Native and prioritizes security.  Examples include:
    *   **CodePush (Microsoft App Center):** A popular choice, but requires careful configuration.
    *   **Other React Native-focused OTA services:** Research alternatives that may offer stronger security features.
2.  **Code Signing (React Native Build Process):** Sign your OTA updates using a private key. The public key should be embedded in your *React Native* application (typically during the build process) to verify the signature before applying the update. This is integrated into the React Native build and deployment workflow.
3.  **Rollback Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism to revert to a previous version of your *React Native* application if an OTA update introduces issues.
4.  **Update Verification (React Native Runtime):** Before applying an update, verify:
    *   The digital signature (using the embedded public key).
    *   The update's integrity.
    *   That the update is intended for your application. This verification happens *within the React Native runtime*.
5.  **User Consent:** Consider prompting the user for consent before downloading and installing an OTA update.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and modifying OTA updates delivered to the React Native application.
*   **Malicious Updates (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from distributing malicious updates to your React Native application.
*   **Update Rollback Failure (Medium Severity):** Ensures that you can revert to a previous version of your React Native app if an update causes problems.

**Impact:**
*   **MitM Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Malicious Updates:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Update Rollback Failure:** Reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   CodePush is used for OTA updates.
*   HTTPS is used for CodePush communication (this is a general best practice, but CodePush handles it).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Code signing is *not* currently implemented for CodePush updates. This is a critical missing security feature, and it needs to be integrated into the React Native build process.
*   Update verification beyond basic HTTPS checks is not performed *within the React Native runtime*.
