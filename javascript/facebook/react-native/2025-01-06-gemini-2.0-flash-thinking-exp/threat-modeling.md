# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/react-native

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Third-Party JavaScript Library](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_third-party_javascript_library.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could introduce malicious code into the application by exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally malicious code within a third-party JavaScript library (NPM package) used by the application. This malicious code executes within the React Native JavaScript environment, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive data managed by the JavaScript code, manipulate the application's behavior, or interact with native modules to access device resources. The attacker might achieve this by compromising a legitimate package or tricking developers into including a malicious one.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (exfiltration of user data, application secrets handled in JavaScript), application malfunction, unauthorized access to device resources via compromised native module interactions.
*   **Affected Component:** JavaScript Engine, specifically the module resolution and execution mechanism within React Native's JavaScript environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet all third-party dependencies before inclusion.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, npm audit, Yarn audit) to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the development pipeline.
    *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a private registry for internal components to control the supply chain.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution Leading to Code Execution or Security Bypass](./threats/prototype_pollution_leading_to_code_execution_or_security_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the application's JavaScript code or within a third-party library to inject properties into the prototypes of built-in JavaScript objects (e.g., `Object.prototype`). Because React Native relies heavily on JavaScript, such pollution can have wide-ranging effects, potentially leading to security bypasses within the application's logic or even allowing remote code execution within the JavaScript environment if the polluted prototype is used in a sensitive context by React Native or its libraries.
*   **Impact:** Security bypasses within the application logic, unauthorized access to features or data, potential remote code execution within the JavaScript environment.
*   **Affected Component:** JavaScript Engine, specifically the prototype inheritance mechanism as utilized by React Native.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Employ secure coding practices, avoiding dynamic property access on potentially untrusted data.
    *   Regularly audit code for potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
    *   Stay updated with security advisories for JavaScript engines and libraries used by React Native.
    *   Consider using tools that can detect and prevent prototype pollution attacks.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via__dangerouslysetinnerhtml_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application if the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop, a feature of React Native, is used to render unsanitized user-provided data. This allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the application's WebView. While not traditional server-side XSS, within the context of a React Native application, this can be leveraged to access local storage managed by React Native, make API calls on behalf of the user using the application's authentication context, or redirect the user to malicious sites, all within the application's runtime.
*   **Impact:** Data theft (accessing local storage), session hijacking (if authentication tokens are exposed), malicious actions performed on behalf of the user within the application's context.
*   **Affected Component:** React Native's rendering engine, specifically the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` whenever possible.
    *   If its use is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize all data before rendering it using trusted libraries (e.g., DOMPurify).

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Custom Native Modules](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_custom_native_modules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws) in custom native modules developed for the application and integrated with React Native. Because these modules interact directly with the device's operating system and hardware, successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device with the privileges of the application, potentially allowing access to sensitive device resources, data, or even complete device compromise.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the device, data breaches (accessing data beyond the application's sandbox), application crashes, device compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The Native Modules interface and the specific custom native modules themselves.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing native modules (using languages like Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS).
    *   Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of native modules.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within native code.
    *   Stay updated with security best practices for the target platform (Android/iOS).
    *   Minimize the complexity and attack surface of custom native modules.
