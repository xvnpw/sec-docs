**Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Supply Chain Attacks via JavaScript Dependencies (High Severity):**  This mitigation strategy directly and effectively addresses the threat of supply chain attacks by proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in JavaScript dependencies, which are a common entry point for such attacks. By scanning dependencies, the strategy helps prevent the introduction of malicious or compromised packages into the React Native application.
*   **Known Vulnerabilities in React Native JavaScript Libraries (High to Medium Severity):**  The strategy is highly effective in mitigating the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in React Native JavaScript libraries. Regular scanning and remediation ensure that the application is not running outdated versions of libraries with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, reducing the attack surface.

**Impact:**

The impact of implementing this mitigation strategy is **significant and positive**. It substantially reduces the risk of:

*   **Data Breaches:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches and compromise of sensitive user information.
*   **Application Downtime:**  Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities can cause application downtime and disruption of services.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Security incidents resulting from vulnerable dependencies can severely damage the organization's reputation and user trust.
*   **Financial Losses:**  Security breaches can lead to financial losses due to incident response costs, regulatory fines, and business disruption.

By proactively addressing JavaScript dependency vulnerabilities, this strategy strengthens the overall security posture of the React Native application and protects against these potential negative impacts.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `npm audit` is run manually before releases.

**Missing Implementation:**

*   **Automation in CI/CD Pipeline:** The most critical missing piece is the **automation of dependency scanning within the React Native project's CI/CD pipeline.** Manual `npm audit` runs before releases are insufficient for continuous security monitoring and can be easily overlooked. Automation ensures consistent and proactive vulnerability detection with every build.
*   **Integration with Dedicated Vulnerability Management Platform:**  The current implementation lacks integration with a **dedicated vulnerability management platform.** While `npm audit` provides basic output, a vulnerability management platform offers centralized tracking, reporting, workflow management, and potentially more advanced features like prioritization and remediation guidance. This is crucial for managing vulnerabilities effectively at scale and across multiple projects.
