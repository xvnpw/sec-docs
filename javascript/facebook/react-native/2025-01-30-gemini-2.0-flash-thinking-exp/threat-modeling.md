# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/react-native

## Threat: [Data Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/data_serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit weaknesses in how data is converted between JavaScript and native code over the bridge. By crafting malicious serialized data, they could trigger code execution or data manipulation during deserialization on either the JavaScript or native side. This often targets custom serialization logic or vulnerabilities in libraries used for serialization.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data corruption, information disclosure, potentially leading to full application compromise or device takeover.
*   **Affected React Native Component:** JavaScript Bridge, Custom Native Modules (if involved in serialization/deserialization), React Native Core (if core bridge implementation is vulnerable).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use well-vetted and secure serialization libraries.
    *   Avoid custom serialization logic if possible, rely on built-in React Native data types for bridge communication.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on both JavaScript and native sides of the bridge to check data integrity after deserialization.
    *   Regularly update React Native and its dependencies to benefit from security patches addressing serialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Bridge Injection Attacks](./threats/bridge_injection_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in native modules or the JavaScript runtime to inject malicious commands or code that are executed via the React Native bridge. This could involve manipulating data sent to native modules or exploiting weaknesses in how the bridge processes communication, leading to arbitrary code execution in either the native or JavaScript context.
*   **Impact:** Code execution on the device, privilege escalation, data manipulation, potentially leading to full device compromise and unauthorized access to device resources.
*   **Affected React Native Component:** JavaScript Bridge, Native Modules, JavaScript Runtime Environment, potentially React Native Core.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly audit and perform security code reviews of all custom native modules.
    *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization in native modules to prevent processing of unexpected or malicious data received from the bridge.
    *   Use secure coding practices in native modules, especially when handling data originating from the JavaScript side.
    *   Keep React Native, native dependencies, and the JavaScript runtime updated to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for injection attacks.
    *   Employ static and dynamic analysis tools to proactively detect potential injection vulnerabilities in native modules and bridge communication logic.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Native Modules (Custom or Third-Party)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_native_modules__custom_or_third-party_.md)

*   **Description:** Custom-built or third-party native modules may contain security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, or insecure API usage. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted inputs to vulnerable native module functions, leading to code execution, denial of service, or unauthorized access to device resources.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, privilege escalation, information disclosure, potentially leading to device takeover and unauthorized control over device functionalities.
*   **Affected React Native Component:** Native Modules (Custom and Third-Party).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Conduct rigorous security code reviews and penetration testing of all custom native modules before deployment.
    *   Carefully vet and select third-party native modules, prioritizing reputable and actively maintained libraries with a strong security track record and community support.
    *   Regularly update third-party native modules to patch known vulnerabilities and stay current with security updates.
    *   Apply secure coding practices during native module development, focusing on memory safety, robust input validation, and secure API usage.
    *   Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in native module code and dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Use of Platform APIs](./threats/insecure_use_of_platform_apis.md)

*   **Description:** React Native applications rely on native modules to interact with platform-specific APIs (Android and iOS). Developers might incorrectly or insecurely use these APIs, leading to vulnerabilities. Examples include improper permission handling, insecure data storage using platform APIs, or vulnerabilities arising from incorrect API parameter usage. Exploiting these misuses can grant attackers unauthorized access to device features or sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data leakage, unauthorized access to device resources (camera, microphone, location, contacts, etc.), potentially leading to significant privacy breaches and unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected React Native Component:** Native Modules, Platform APIs (Android/iOS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly adhere to platform-specific security best practices and guidelines when using native APIs (refer to Android and iOS security documentation).
    *   Implement proper and least-privilege permission handling, requesting only necessary permissions and clearly explaining their purpose to the user.
    *   Utilize secure storage mechanisms provided by the platform (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android) for sensitive data instead of less secure alternatives like `AsyncStorage` for highly sensitive information.
    *   Thoroughly test API integrations and handle API responses securely, validating data received from platform APIs.
    *   Stay informed about platform-specific security advisories and promptly update target platform SDKs to address potential API-related vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates Vulnerabilities (If Implemented)](./threats/over-the-air__ota__updates_vulnerabilities__if_implemented_.md)

*   **Description:** React Native's Over-the-Air (OTA) update capability, while convenient, can be exploited if not implemented securely. Attackers could compromise the OTA update mechanism to distribute malicious updates, bypassing app store security reviews. This could involve compromising the update server, performing man-in-the-middle attacks during update delivery, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the update process itself.
*   **Impact:** Distribution of malware through application updates, application takeover, data breaches, circumvention of app store security reviews, potentially affecting a large user base.
*   **Affected React Native Component:** OTA Update Mechanism, Update Server, Application Update Process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a robust and secure OTA update mechanism with mandatory code signing and integrity checks for all update packages. Verify signatures before applying updates.
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication related to OTA updates, including downloading update packages and communicating with the update server, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for update servers, ensuring only authorized servers can push updates and preventing unauthorized access.
    *   Carefully consider the security implications of bypassing app store review processes with OTA updates and implement additional security layers to compensate.
    *   Develop and test rollback mechanisms to revert to a previous secure version of the application in case of failed or malicious updates.
