    *   Exploitation can range from simple script execution to complex remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.


## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Outdated or Unpatched Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__outdated_or_unpatched_libraries.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Attackers scan for applications using outdated versions of npm packages with known vulnerabilities.
        *   Publicly available exploits or exploit modules can be used to target these vulnerabilities.
        *   Exploitation often leads to arbitrary code execution within the application's JavaScript context.


## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Malicious Packages (Supply Chain Attack) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__malicious_packages__supply_chain_attack___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Sensitive data (API keys, secrets, user credentials) may be unintentionally hardcoded in JavaScript code.
        *   Insecure storage mechanisms like `AsyncStorage` or local storage may be used for sensitive data without proper encryption.
        *   Attackers can extract hardcoded secrets from decompiled JavaScript bundles.
        *   Attackers can access and manipulate data stored insecurely in local storage or `AsyncStorage`.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   React Native applications often utilize community-developed native modules for platform-specific functionalities.
    *   These modules may contain vulnerabilities or malicious code, similar to npm packages.
    *   Native module vulnerabilities can lead to more severe consequences due to their direct interaction with the device's operating system and hardware.


## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Community Modules](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_popular_community_modules.md)

        *   Exploits for known vulnerabilities can be used to compromise the application or the device.


## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2. Backdoors or Malicious Code in Community Modules (Supply Chain Risk) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2__backdoors_or_malicious_code_in_community_modules__supply_chain_risk___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Malicious actors may inject backdoors or malicious code into community native modules.
        *   This can be achieved by compromising module maintainer accounts or through other supply chain attack techniques.
        *   Malicious code in native modules can have a wider range of capabilities compared to JavaScript code, including direct access to device resources and system-level operations.
        *   Detection of malicious code in native modules is more challenging due to the compiled nature of native code.


## Attack Tree Path: [3. Build and Deployment Process Vulnerabilities (React Native Specific) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__build_and_deployment_process_vulnerabilities__react_native_specific___critical_node_.md)

    *   Compromised build environments or insecure dependency management can lead to the injection of malicious code into the final application package.
    *   Compromised app store accounts can be used to distribute malicious updates or applications.


## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Insecure Build Pipeline [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__insecure_build_pipeline__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   The build pipeline may be vulnerable to compromise if not properly secured.
        *   Attackers can target the build environment to inject malicious code during the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Compromised Build Environment [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__compromised_build_environment__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Attackers gain unauthorized access to the build servers or developer workstations used for building the React Native application.
            *   Once compromised, attackers can modify the build process to inject malicious code into the application bundle or native binaries.
            *   This can result in the distribution of a Trojanized application to users.


## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.2. Dependency Confusion Attacks during Build [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_2__dependency_confusion_attacks_during_build__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Attackers exploit the dependency resolution mechanism during the build process.
            *   By publishing malicious packages with the same names as internal or private dependencies on public package registries, attackers can trick the build system into downloading and using their malicious packages instead of the legitimate ones.
            *   This allows attackers to inject malicious code into the application during the build process.


## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.2. App Store Account Compromise [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_2__app_store_account_compromise__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Attackers compromise developer accounts on app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store) through phishing, credential stuffing, or other account takeover techniques.
        *   Once an account is compromised, attackers can upload malicious updates to existing applications or publish entirely new malicious applications under the compromised developer account.
        *   This can lead to wide-scale distribution of malware to unsuspecting users.


## Attack Tree Path: [4. Reverse Engineering and Code Tampering [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__reverse_engineering_and_code_tampering__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   React Native applications are inherently vulnerable to reverse engineering due to the nature of JavaScript and the application bundle.

    *   Reverse engineering can be used to identify vulnerabilities, extract secrets, and understand application functionality for malicious purposes.


## Attack Tree Path: [6.1. Static Analysis and Decompilation of JavaScript Bundle [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6_1__static_analysis_and_decompilation_of_javascript_bundle__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   The JavaScript bundle of a React Native application is readily available within the application package.
        *   Decompilation tools can easily convert the bundled JavaScript code back into a readable format.
        *   Static analysis of the decompiled code allows attackers to understand the application's logic, identify potential vulnerabilities, and extract sensitive information.


## Attack Tree Path: [6.1.1. Extracting Sensitive Information from Decompiled JavaScript [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6_1_1__extracting_sensitive_information_from_decompiled_javascript__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Attackers use decompilation tools to extract the JavaScript bundle from the React Native application.
            *   They then analyze the decompiled code to search for hardcoded API keys, secret tokens, backend URLs, or other sensitive information.
            *   Extracted sensitive information can be used for unauthorized access, data breaches, or further attacks.


## Attack Tree Path: [6.1.2. Identifying Logic Flaws and Vulnerabilities through Static Analysis](./attack_tree_paths/6_1_2__identifying_logic_flaws_and_vulnerabilities_through_static_analysis.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Attackers analyze the decompiled JavaScript code to identify logic flaws, insecure coding practices, or potential vulnerabilities.
            *   Static analysis can reveal vulnerabilities such as insecure data handling, business logic flaws, or potential injection points.
            *   Identified vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise the application.
