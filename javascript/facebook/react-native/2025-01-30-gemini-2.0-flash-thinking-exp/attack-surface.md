# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/react-native

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Bridge Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/javascript_bridge_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the communication channel (the bridge) between JavaScript and native code in React Native applications.
*   **React Native Contribution:** React Native's core architecture *fundamentally relies* on the JavaScript bridge.  It is the central point of interaction between the JavaScript UI logic and the native device functionalities.  Vulnerabilities here are inherently tied to React Native's design.
*   **Example:** A native module deserializes JSON data from JavaScript without proper type checking. An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload with unexpected data types that triggers a type confusion vulnerability in the native code, leading to memory corruption and potential remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data manipulation, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Data Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for *all* data crossing the bridge from JavaScript to native. Enforce type checking and range validation.
        *   **Secure Serialization Practices:** Use secure and well-vetted serialization libraries. Avoid custom serialization/deserialization logic where possible.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Native Modules:** Design native modules to expose the *minimum necessary* API surface to JavaScript. Limit the functionalities accessible via the bridge.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct frequent security code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting the bridge communication and native module interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Native Modules](./attack_surfaces/insecure_native_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within *custom* native modules written in platform-specific languages (Java/Kotlin for Android, Objective-C/Swift for iOS). These vulnerabilities are directly introduced by developers extending React Native's capabilities.
*   **React Native Contribution:** React Native *encourages* and *necessitates* the creation of native modules for accessing platform-specific features not available in JavaScript.  Insecurely written native modules directly become part of the React Native application's attack surface.
*   **Example:** A native module responsible for file system access is implemented with a path traversal vulnerability.  JavaScript code can use this module to access files outside of the intended application sandbox by crafting malicious file paths passed through the bridge.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches (access to sensitive files), unauthorized access to device resources, privilege escalation, potentially remote code execution if native module vulnerabilities are severe enough.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability type and the sensitivity of the resources accessed by the native module).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Native Coding Practices:** Adhere to strict secure coding guidelines for the target platform (Android/iOS) when developing native modules.  Focus on preventing common native vulnerabilities like path traversal, buffer overflows, format string bugs, and injection flaws.
        *   **Robust Input Validation in Native Modules:**  Thoroughly validate *all* inputs received from JavaScript within native modules *before* using them in native code operations.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Native Module Permissions:** Request and utilize only the *minimum necessary* native permissions required for the module's functionality. Avoid over-permissioning.
        *   **Security Testing of Native Modules:**  Mandatory security testing, including static analysis and dynamic testing, of all custom native modules.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates](./attack_surfaces/insecure_over-the-air__ota__updates.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the process of delivering and applying application updates *over-the-air*, a feature commonly used in React Native development to bypass traditional app store update cycles.
*   **React Native Contribution:** React Native's ecosystem *promotes* and *facilitates* OTA updates (through libraries like CodePush and Expo Updates) as a core development workflow advantage.  If OTA update mechanisms are insecure, they become a direct and significant React Native-specific attack vector.
*   **Example:** An application uses CodePush for OTA updates but fails to properly verify the code signing signature of updates. An attacker compromises the update server or performs a MITM attack and injects a malicious update package. The application, lacking signature verification, installs the compromised update, leading to widespread malware distribution.
*   **Impact:** Malware distribution to a large user base, complete application compromise, data theft, remote code execution on user devices.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Mandatory HTTPS for OTA Updates:** *Always* use HTTPS for all OTA update communication to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
        *   **Cryptographic Signing and Integrity Checks:** Implement *strong* cryptographic code signing for OTA updates.  *Strictly verify* signatures and/or checksums before applying any update.
        *   **Secure OTA Update Infrastructure:** Harden the OTA update server infrastructure and access controls to prevent unauthorized access and tampering with update packages.
        *   **Rollback and Recovery Mechanisms:** Implement robust rollback mechanisms to revert to previous versions in case of failed or malicious updates. Thoroughly test rollback procedures.
