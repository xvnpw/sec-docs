## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JavaScript Bridge Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_javascript_bridge_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vector: Hook into Native Bridge Implementation
    *   Description: Attackers aim to intercept or manipulate the underlying native code that facilitates communication with the JavaScript layer.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Native Modules Handling Bridge Messages
        *   Description: Exploiting flaws (e.g., buffer overflows, logic errors) in native modules that receive and process messages from the JavaScript bridge. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the native context.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Bridge Messages
        *   Description:  Manipulating serialized data exchanged over the bridge to inject malicious payloads. If the native code doesn't properly sanitize or validate deserialized data, it can lead to code execution or other unintended consequences.
*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious JavaScript Code
    *   Description: Introducing harmful JavaScript code into the application's runtime environment.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries
        *   Description: Leveraging known security weaknesses in external JavaScript libraries used by the React Native application. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or compromise application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Native Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_native_module_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflows, etc.)
    *   Description:  Targeting vulnerabilities in native code that arise from improper memory management. Buffer overflows can allow attackers to overwrite memory regions, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflows, etc.)
        *   Description: Directly exploiting memory corruption bugs in custom native modules.
*   Attack Vector: Exploit Insecure Data Handling in Native Modules
    *   Description: Taking advantage of how native modules handle sensitive data.
    *   Critical Node: Storing Sensitive Data Insecurely
        *   Description:  Finding and exploiting instances where native modules store sensitive information (like API keys, user credentials) in insecure locations without proper encryption or protection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party React Native Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_react_native_libraries.md)

*   Attack Vector: Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies
    *   Description: Exploiting publicly disclosed security flaws in the npm packages used by the React Native application.
    *   Critical Node: Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies
        *   Description: Identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies. This often involves using publicly available exploits or crafting custom exploits based on vulnerability details.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Data Storage Practices](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_data_storage_practices.md)

*   Attack Vector: Store Sensitive Data in AsyncStorage Without Encryption
    *   Description:  Exploiting the lack of encryption for sensitive data stored using React Native's AsyncStorage. This data can be easily accessed on a compromised device.
    *   Critical Node: Store Sensitive Data in AsyncStorage Without Encryption
        *   Description: Directly accessing and extracting sensitive data stored in AsyncStorage without encryption.
*   Attack Vector: Store Sensitive Data in Local Storage or SharedPreferences Without Encryption
    *   Description:  Similar to AsyncStorage, exploiting the lack of encryption for data stored in platform-specific local storage mechanisms.
    *   Critical Node: Store Sensitive Data in Local Storage or SharedPreferences Without Encryption
        *   Description: Directly accessing and extracting sensitive data stored in platform-specific local storage or shared preferences without encryption.
