# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/react-native

## Threat: [Data Interception via the JavaScript Bridge](./threats/data_interception_via_the_javascript_bridge.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially intercept communication between the JavaScript thread and the native thread, which is a core mechanism of React Native. This could involve using debugging tools, hooking into the bridge's communication channels, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system. The attacker might passively listen to the data being exchanged or actively modify it in transit.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data (credentials, personal information, financial details), manipulation of application state leading to unauthorized actions or data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [JavaScript Injection through the Bridge](./threats/javascript_injection_through_the_bridge.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the native context or vice versa by exploiting vulnerabilities in how data is handled when passed through the bridge. This is a direct consequence of React Native's architecture where JavaScript interacts with native components. This could happen if user-controlled data is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in native code or when native code sends unsanitized data to the JavaScript side for execution (e.g., using `eval` or similar constructs).

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the device, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Native Modules](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_native_modules.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in native modules, which are fundamental to extending React Native's capabilities and accessing platform-specific features. This could involve sending specially crafted inputs to native module functions or leveraging memory corruption issues within the native code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, denial of service, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Malicious Native Module Inclusion](./threats/malicious_native_module_inclusion.md)

**Description:** Developers might unknowingly include a malicious native module in their application. Since native modules have direct access to device resources and APIs, a malicious module can perform significant harm. This is a risk inherent in React Native's reliance on native code for certain functionalities.

**Impact:** Data theft, installation of malware, backdoor access to the device, unauthorized access to device resources.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
