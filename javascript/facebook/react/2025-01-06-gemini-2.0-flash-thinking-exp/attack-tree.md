## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__attacks.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Bypassing React's Default Sanitization (Critical Node):**
        *   Utilizing `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with untrusted data. This allows direct injection of HTML, including `<script>` tags, bypassing React's built-in protections against XSS.
        *   Injecting malicious scripts via user input that is not properly sanitized before being rendered using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
        *   Injecting malicious scripts via server-side data that is not adequately sanitized before React renders it using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
    *   **Impact:** Successful XSS attacks can lead to:
        *   Session hijacking and account takeover.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Defacement of the application.
        *   Stealing sensitive user information.
        *   Executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Third-Party React Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_third-party_react_components.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerable Component with XSS Flaw (Critical Node):**
        *   Using a third-party React component that contains a known or zero-day XSS vulnerability.
        *   Injecting malicious scripts through component props that are not properly sanitized by the vulnerable component.
        *   Injecting malicious scripts through component state that is manipulated to execute harmful code.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to general XSS attacks, exploiting vulnerable components can result in:
        *   Account compromise.
        *   Data theft.
        *   Malware distribution.
        *   Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Injecting Scripts during SSR Phase (Critical Node):**
        *   Manipulating data used during the server-side rendering process to include malicious `<script>` tags or JavaScript code.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities within the SSR framework itself (e.g., Next.js, Remix) that allow for script injection.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
        *   XSS vulnerabilities that are rendered directly in the initial HTML, potentially bypassing some client-side defenses.
        *   Exposure of server-side data or functionality.
        *   Compromise of the server rendering process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies and Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_and_build_process.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Critical Node):**
        *   **Compromised React Package (Critical Node):** Using a maliciously modified version of the official React library, potentially obtained from unofficial or compromised sources. This allows attackers to inject backdoors or malicious code directly into the application.
        *   **Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries (Critical Node):**  Including third-party React components or utility libraries that contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access or execute code within the application.
    *   **Build Process Compromise (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Malicious Code Injection during Build (Critical Node):** Compromising the build tools or scripts used to create the final application bundle. This allows attackers to inject malicious code that will be included in every deployment of the application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete control over the application's codebase and functionality.
        *   Data breaches and exfiltration.
        *   Deployment of malware to end-users.
        *   Long-term, persistent compromise that is difficult to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SSR Injection Attacks (Critical Node):**
        *   **HTML Injection:** Injecting malicious HTML tags into the server-rendered output by manipulating data used during the SSR process. This can lead to defacement or redirection.
        *   **Code Injection:** Injecting server-side code during the SSR process by exploiting vulnerabilities in the SSR framework or backend logic. This can lead to remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
        *   Server-side code execution.
        *   Exposure of sensitive server-side data.
        *   Compromise of the server rendering process.
