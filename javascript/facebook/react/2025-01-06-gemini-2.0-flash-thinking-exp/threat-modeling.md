# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/react

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Improper JSX Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_improper_jsx_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) into user-provided data that is then rendered directly within JSX without proper sanitization. The React rendering engine interprets and executes this script in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, defacing the page, or performing actions on the user's behalf.
*   **Affected React Component:** JSX rendering mechanism, specifically when rendering variables containing user input.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize React's built-in escaping for text content within JSX (default behavior for direct variable rendering).
    *   Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized user input.
    *   Sanitize user input on the server-side before sending it to the client as a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via__dangerouslysetinnerhtml_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious HTML content that is directly inserted into the DOM using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop without proper sanitization. React's component rendering then includes this malicious HTML in the final output.
*   **Impact:** Similar to the previous XSS threat, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript, steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the application.
*   **Affected React Component:** Components utilizing the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Absolutely avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user-provided data unless absolutely necessary.
    *   If `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is required, rigorously sanitize the HTML content using a trusted library like DOMPurify before passing it to the prop.

## Threat: [Client-Side Logic Tampering](./threats/client-side_logic_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses browser developer tools or intercepts network requests to modify the application's JavaScript code, which is the core of a React application. They can alter variables, function behavior within React components, or bypass client-side validation implemented in React.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can bypass security checks, manipulate data before it's sent to the server (e.g., changing prices in an e-commerce application), or alter the application's behavior in unintended ways, directly impacting the functionality of React components.
*   **Affected React Component:** All client-side React components and the overall application bundle.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never rely solely on client-side validation implemented in React for security. Always perform validation on the server-side.
    *   Implement server-side authorization and authentication to protect sensitive actions, regardless of client-side logic.
    *   Minimize sensitive logic within React components on the client-side.
    *   Use code obfuscation (though it's not a foolproof solution) to make client-side React code harder to understand and modify.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Client-Side Code](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_client-side_code.md)

*   **Description:** Developers inadvertently embed sensitive information like API keys, secret keys, or internal URLs directly within the React codebase or component logic. Attackers can inspect the client-side bundle generated by React to extract this information.
*   **Impact:** Exposed API keys can be used to access backend services, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions. Exposed secret keys can compromise cryptographic operations.
*   **Affected React Component:** Any component where sensitive data is hardcoded or improperly managed within its logic or JSX.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store sensitive information in secure environment variables and access them appropriately (e.g., through build processes or backend services).
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the backend server when needed, rather than embedding it directly in React components.
    *   Avoid committing sensitive information to version control systems.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party React Components](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_react_components.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in third-party React components or libraries used in the application. These components extend React's functionality and their vulnerabilities become part of the application's attack surface.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the third-party component. It could range from XSS and arbitrary code execution within the React application's context to denial of service or data breaches.
*   **Affected React Component:** Any component that utilizes the vulnerable third-party library or component.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update all React dependencies, including third-party components, to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Carefully vet third-party components before using them in the project. Check for security audits and community reputation.
    *   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool for more comprehensive dependency security management.
