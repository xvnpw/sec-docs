## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Inputs and Escape Outputs within React Components](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_inputs_and_escape_outputs_within_react_components.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify User Input Points in React Components:** Pinpoint all locations within your React components where user-provided data is incorporated into the rendered output. This includes data from form inputs, props, context, or any external source influenced by user actions.
2.  **Utilize React's JSX Escaping by Default:** Leverage React's inherent JSX syntax for rendering dynamic content. JSX automatically escapes values, which is the primary defense against many common XSS attacks. Ensure you are consistently using JSX for dynamic content rendering.
3.  **Exercise Extreme Caution with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:**  Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary. This React prop bypasses React's built-in escaping and renders raw HTML. If you must use it:
    *   **Sanitize HTML *Before* Rendering:**  Employ a robust HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify) to clean the HTML string *before* passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
    *   **Trust the Source:** Only use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with HTML from highly trusted sources. User-provided HTML should *never* be directly rendered with this prop without rigorous sanitization.
    *   **Document Usage:** Clearly document the reasons for using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and the sanitization measures implemented in the component.
4.  **Sanitize Props and Context Data:** If you are passing data as props or through React Context that originates from user input or external untrusted sources, ensure this data is sanitized *before* it is passed down and rendered within child components.
5.  **Review Components for Direct DOM Manipulation:** If your React components directly manipulate the DOM using `ref` and native DOM APIs (though less common in typical React usage), ensure you are applying proper escaping and sanitization when setting content or attributes directly on DOM elements.

**Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts through user inputs that could be executed in other users' browsers when rendered by React components. This includes both reflected and stored XSS scenarios.

**Impact:**

*   **XSS - High Risk Reduction:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities by ensuring that user-provided data is properly escaped or sanitized before being rendered by React, leveraging React's built-in escaping and emphasizing safe usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

**Currently Implemented:**

*   **Partially Implemented:** React's default JSX escaping is inherently used throughout the application. However, awareness and strict control over `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage and explicit sanitization for HTML rendering are not consistently enforced across all components.

**Missing Implementation:**

*   **Consistent `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` Review:**  A systematic review process to identify and minimize or eliminate unnecessary uses of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` across the codebase.
*   **Explicit Sanitization for HTML Rendering Components:** Components that handle and render HTML content dynamically need to be audited and updated to incorporate robust HTML sanitization (e.g., using DOMPurify) before rendering with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` if absolutely necessary.
*   **Developer Guidelines for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:**  Establish clear and enforced development guidelines that strongly discourage the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and mandate sanitization when its use is unavoidable.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Address Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Security with React](./mitigation_strategies/address_server-side_rendering__ssr__security_with_react.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Server-Side Sanitization in React SSR:** When using React for Server-Side Rendering, ensure that any dynamic data rendered on the server within your React components is sanitized *before* React generates the initial HTML. React SSR itself does not automatically sanitize data; you must implement sanitization within your server-side React code.
2.  **Secure Data Handling in Server-Side React Components:** Develop React components intended for server-side rendering with the same security rigor as backend services. Apply input validation and secure data handling practices within these components to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced during the SSR process.
3.  **Client-Side Hydration Validation (React Hydration):** When the client-side React application hydrates from the server-rendered HTML (React's hydration process), consider validating any critical data received from the server. This can help detect and mitigate potential issues if the server-side rendering process was compromised or data was tampered with in transit.
4.  **Secure Server Environment for React SSR:** Ensure the server environment where React SSR is performed is secure. This includes proper access controls, timely security updates for server software, and server hardening measures. A compromised server environment can undermine the security of the entire SSR process.
5.  **Review React SSR Logic for Vulnerabilities:** Conduct security reviews specifically focused on the React SSR implementation. Examine data flow within server-side React components, input processing, and HTML output generation to identify potential vulnerabilities unique to the SSR context.

**Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Server-Side XSS - High Severity:** If server-side React components inject unsanitized data during SSR, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities directly in the initial HTML. These vulnerabilities can be particularly dangerous as they execute before client-side React code even runs, potentially bypassing some client-side protections.
*   **Data Injection during React Hydration - Medium Severity:** If data from the server is not handled carefully during React's hydration process, attackers might potentially manipulate this data to inject malicious content or alter application behavior as the client-side React application takes over.

**Impact:**

*   **Server-Side XSS - High Risk Reduction:** Prevents server-side XSS by enforcing sanitization of dynamic data within React components *during* the server-side rendering phase.
*   **Data Injection during React Hydration - Medium Risk Reduction:** Reduces the risk of data manipulation during client-side hydration by promoting validation of server-provided data as React takes over rendering on the client.

**Currently Implemented:**

*   **Partially Implemented:** Server-side rendering using React is implemented. However, explicit sanitization within server-side React components and validation during client-side hydration are not consistently applied. Server environment security is generally maintained but could be specifically reviewed for the SSR context.

**Missing Implementation:**

*   **Server-Side React Sanitization Implementation:** Implement robust sanitization logic within React components that are rendered server-side, ensuring dynamic data is cleaned before HTML generation.
*   **Client-Side React Hydration Validation:** Add validation steps in the client-side React application to verify the integrity and safety of data received from the server during the hydration process.
*   **Dedicated React SSR Security Review:** Conduct a focused security review specifically on the React SSR implementation, paying close attention to data handling, input processing in server-side components, and the overall SSR workflow.
*   **SSR Environment Security Hardening:**  Specifically review and enhance the security configuration and hardening of the server environment used for React SSR, considering its role in generating the initial application HTML.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure State Management in React Applications](./mitigation_strategies/secure_state_management_in_react_applications.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Minimize Client-Side Storage of Sensitive Data in React State:**  Avoid storing highly sensitive information (like passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information - PII) directly within React component state (using `useState`, `useReducer`, or Context API) if possible, especially if this state is persisted in browser storage (e.g., through libraries that persist state to `localStorage`).
2.  **Use Secure Storage for Necessary Client-Side Sensitive Data (with React Context or State):** If sensitive data *must* be managed in React state and stored client-side:
    *   **Prefer `sessionStorage`:** Use `sessionStorage` for temporary, session-based storage rather than `localStorage` for persistent storage, as `sessionStorage` is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.
    *   **Consider Encryption:** If sensitive data is stored client-side, even in `sessionStorage`, consider encrypting it before storing and decrypting upon retrieval. Be aware of the complexities and potential risks of client-side encryption.
    *   **Acknowledge Client-Side Storage Risks:** Understand and document the inherent risks associated with storing sensitive data client-side, even with secure storage mechanisms.
3.  **Implement Access Control in React State Management Logic:** In complex React applications, especially those using Context API or more advanced state management patterns, ensure that state updates and data access are controlled and authorized appropriately within the state management logic. This is particularly relevant for applications with different user roles or permission levels.
4.  **Regularly Review React State Management for Security Implications:** During code reviews and security assessments, specifically examine how React state is managed, looking for potential security vulnerabilities such as unintentional exposure of sensitive data in state or insecure handling of state updates.
5.  **Consider Server-Side State for Highly Sensitive Data (Backend Integration with React):** For extremely sensitive data, explore architectural patterns that minimize client-side state management of this data. Consider using backend-for-frontend (BFF) patterns or server-side session management to keep highly sensitive data primarily on the server and only transmit necessary, less sensitive data to the React client.

**Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure via React State - High Severity:** Storing sensitive data insecurely within React component state, especially if persisted client-side, can lead to data breaches if an attacker gains access to the user's browser environment or local storage.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Data in React State - Medium Severity:** Improper access control within React state management logic can potentially allow unauthorized components or users to access or modify sensitive data held within the application's React state.

**Impact:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure - High Risk Reduction:** Minimizing client-side storage of sensitive data in React state and using secure storage mechanisms when necessary significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Data - Medium Risk Reduction:** Implementing access control within React state management logic helps prevent unauthorized data access within the React application's state.

**Currently Implemented:**

*   **Partially Implemented:** General awareness exists about avoiding storage of highly sensitive data directly in easily accessible client-side storage. However, explicit guidelines and systematic reviews of React state management for security are not fully implemented. Secure storage mechanisms are not consistently used for sensitive data that is unavoidably managed in React state client-side.

**Missing Implementation:**

*   **Data Sensitivity Audit in React State:** Conduct a specific audit of the application's React state management to identify any instances where sensitive data is being stored client-side within React components.
*   **Secure Storage Implementation for React State:** Implement secure storage mechanisms (e.g., `sessionStorage`, encryption if necessary) for any unavoidable client-side storage of sensitive data managed within React state.
*   **Access Control in React State Management Logic:** Implement access control logic within React state management, particularly for features that handle sensitive data or user permissions, ensuring that state updates and data access are appropriately controlled within React components and state management patterns.
*   **React State Management Security Guidelines:**  Establish clear guidelines and best practices specifically for secure state management in React applications, including recommendations for handling sensitive data within React components and state management APIs.
