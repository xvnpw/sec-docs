# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/react

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is then rendered by a React component without proper sanitization. The `react-dom` library, responsible for updating the DOM, will render this script, causing the browser to execute it. This can lead to account takeover, data theft, malicious redirects, or website defacement.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malicious redirects, website defacement.

**Affected React Component:** `react-dom` (specifically the rendering engine handling JSX and dynamic content).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Primarily rely on JSX's default escaping mechanism, which automatically escapes values rendered within JSX tags, preventing the execution of malicious scripts.
* Exercise extreme caution when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. If necessary, sanitize untrusted HTML using a well-vetted library like `DOMPurify` *before* passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
* Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data through Insecure State Management](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_insecure_state_management.md)

**Description:** While the specific state management implementation might vary (e.g., using `useState`, `useContext`, or external libraries), vulnerabilities can arise from how React components interact with and expose this state. An attacker might be able to access sensitive data if it's stored in the component's state without proper protection or if the state management logic inadvertently makes it accessible.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized data modification.

**Affected React Component:** `react` (specifically the state management hooks like `useState`, `useContext`) and the component's rendering logic that utilizes this state.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in the client-side React state if possible. Consider storing it in a more secure backend and fetching it only when needed.
* If sensitive data must be stored client-side, consider encrypting it within the state.
* Implement proper access control logic within components to restrict access to sensitive state data based on user roles or permissions.
* Regularly review the component's state management logic to ensure no unintended data exposure is occurring.

## Threat: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (SSX) in SSR Applications](./threats/server-side_cross-site_scripting__ssx__in_ssr_applications.md)

**Description:** In applications using Server-Side Rendering (SSR), if user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being rendered into the initial HTML by `react-dom/server`, an attacker can inject malicious scripts. When the server renders the component, this script becomes part of the HTML sent to the client, and the browser will execute it.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malicious redirects, website defacement (potentially impacting SEO and initial load performance).

**Affected React Component:** `react-dom/server` (specifically the rendering functions used for SSR, such as `renderToString` or `renderToStaticMarkup`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Apply strict sanitization to any user-provided data before rendering it on the server using `react-dom/server`. Employ libraries like `DOMPurify` on the server-side.
* Implement proper output encoding to ensure that characters are rendered safely in the HTML.
* Utilize a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of any potential SSX vulnerabilities, even on the initial server-rendered content.
