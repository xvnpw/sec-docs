# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/react

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe HTML Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsafe_html_rendering.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**How React Contributes:** The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop allows rendering raw HTML. If user-controlled data is passed to this prop without proper sanitization, it bypasses React's built-in protection against XSS.

**Example:**
```javascript
function MyComponent({ userInput }) {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: userInput }} />;
}
```
If `userInput` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, it will be executed.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` whenever possible.**
*   **If `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is necessary, sanitize the input using a trusted library like DOMPurify before rendering.**
*   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.**

## Attack Surface: [Logic Flaws in Components Leading to State Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/logic_flaws_in_components_leading_to_state_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in component logic allow attackers to manipulate the application's state in unintended ways, leading to security breaches.

**How React Contributes:** The component-based architecture and state management mechanisms (using `useState`, `useReducer`, or external libraries like Redux) can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented carefully. Improper handling of user input or asynchronous operations can lead to unexpected state changes that bypass security checks or expose sensitive data.

**Example:** A component that allows users to update their roles but doesn't properly validate the input:
```javascript
function UserSettings({ setUserRole }) {
  const handleRoleChange = (event) => {
    setUserRole(event.target.value); // No validation
  };
  return <input type="text" onChange={handleRoleChange} />;
}
```
An attacker could potentially set their role to an administrative one.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to data or functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization within components before updating state.**
*   **Follow the principle of least privilege when managing state and user roles.**
*   **Carefully handle asynchronous operations to prevent race conditions and unexpected state updates.**
*   **Utilize state management patterns that enforce data integrity and prevent unauthorized modifications.**

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Related Issues](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__related_issues.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities specific to applications using server-side rendering, primarily concerning the injection of unsanitized data into the initial HTML.

**How React Contributes:** When using SSR, React components are rendered on the server. If user-provided data is directly injected into the rendered HTML without proper escaping on the server-side, it can lead to XSS.

**Example:** Directly embedding user input into the server-rendered HTML:
```javascript
// Server-side code (Node.js with Express)
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const userName = req.query.name;
  const html = `<h1>Hello, ${userName}</h1><div id="root"></div>`;
  res.send(html);
});
```
If `req.query.name` is `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, it will be executed.

**Impact:** XSS, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Ensure all user-provided data is properly escaped on the server-side before rendering the initial HTML.**
*   **Utilize React's built-in mechanisms for escaping during server-side rendering or use dedicated sanitization libraries.**
*   **Implement robust input validation on the server.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Client-Side Bundles](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_client-side_bundles.md)

**Description:** Accidental inclusion of sensitive information (like API keys, secrets) in the JavaScript bundles delivered to the client.

**How React Contributes:** Developers might inadvertently hardcode sensitive data within React components or configuration files that are then bundled by tools like Webpack or Parcel. This makes the data accessible in the browser's developer tools.

**Example:**
```javascript
// In a React component
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY'; // Hardcoded API key
```
This API key will be visible in the browser's developer tools.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend services, data breaches, potential financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in the client-side code.**
*   **Use environment variables to manage sensitive configuration, ensuring they are not directly embedded in the client-side bundle during the build process.**
*   **Implement proper build processes and utilize tools to prevent the inclusion of sensitive data in the final bundles.**
*   **Utilize backend-for-frontend (BFF) patterns to handle sensitive operations on the server-side, minimizing the need for client-side secrets.**
