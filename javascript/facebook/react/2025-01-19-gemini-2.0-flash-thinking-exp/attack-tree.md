## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via React Components -> Inject Malicious Code via Props/State Updates](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_rendering_vulnerabilities_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_react_components_-_in_4b82fe84.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application's data flow (props or state). When React renders the component using this malicious data, the script executes in the user's browser.
    * Likelihood: Medium - While common, proper input sanitization and output encoding can mitigate this.
    * Impact: High - Can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
    * Effort: Medium - Requires understanding of React's data flow and potential injection points.
    * Skill Level: Intermediate - Requires knowledge of XSS techniques and React development.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium - Can be detected through security scanning tools and monitoring for unexpected script execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party React Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_rendering_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_react_compone_1661f890.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker leverages known vulnerabilities in third-party React components used by the application. This could involve exploiting outdated versions or components with known security flaws.
    * Likelihood: Medium - Many applications use third-party components, and vulnerabilities are frequently discovered.
    * Impact: High - The impact depends on the vulnerability, but can range from XSS to remote code execution.
    * Effort: Low - Often involves using readily available exploits or tools targeting known vulnerabilities.
    * Skill Level: Beginner - Can be exploited by individuals with basic knowledge using public exploits.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium - Can be detected by vulnerability scanning tools and monitoring dependency versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Routing/Navigation -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization on Client-Side Routes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_routingnavigation_-_bypass_authenticationauthorization_on_client-side_routes.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker manipulates the client-side routing logic to access protected routes or resources without proper authentication or authorization. This occurs when the application relies solely on client-side checks for security.
    * Likelihood: High - A common mistake in web development, especially in single-page applications.
    * Impact: High - Allows unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.
    * Effort: Low - Often involves simply changing the URL or manipulating browser history.
    * Skill Level: Beginner - Requires minimal technical skills.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium - Can be detected by monitoring server-side access logs for unauthorized requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in React Ecosystem Libraries -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party React Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_react_ecosystem_libraries_-_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_third-party__ad63439b.md)

* Attack Vector: Similar to exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party components, but focuses on the broader ecosystem of libraries used with React. Attackers target known vulnerabilities in these libraries.
    * Likelihood: Medium - The React ecosystem is vast, and vulnerabilities are discovered regularly.
    * Impact: High - Can lead to various security breaches depending on the vulnerable library.
    * Effort: Low - Often involves using readily available exploits.
    * Skill Level: Beginner - Can be exploited using public exploits.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium - Can be detected by vulnerability scanning tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

* Significance: This is a primary entry point for client-side attacks like XSS. Successful exploitation can directly compromise user sessions and data.
    * Mitigation Focus: Implement strong input sanitization, output encoding, and Content Security Policy (CSP). Regularly audit React components for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party React Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_react_components.md)

* Significance: Third-party components are a common source of vulnerabilities. Exploiting them can have a wide-ranging impact depending on the component's role.
    * Mitigation Focus: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of third-party components. Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or npm audit. Implement a process for promptly updating vulnerable components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization on Client-Side Routes](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_on_client-side_routes.md)

* Significance: This directly undermines the application's access control, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive areas.
    * Mitigation Focus: Implement robust server-side authentication and authorization checks for all protected routes and resources. Never rely solely on client-side checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in React Ecosystem Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_react_ecosystem_libraries.md)

* Significance: The entire application can be compromised if a core library or a widely used utility library has a vulnerability.
    * Mitigation Focus: Similar to third-party components, maintain an inventory, scan for vulnerabilities, and have a process for updating libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party React Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_react_libraries.md)

* Significance: This is a very common attack vector due to the widespread use of third-party libraries and the lag in applying updates.
    * Mitigation Focus: Proactive vulnerability management is key. Use automated tools to identify and track vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Process/Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_processdependencies.md)

* Significance: While lower in likelihood, a successful attack here can have a catastrophic impact, allowing attackers to inject malicious code directly into the application's core.
    * Mitigation Focus: Secure the build environment, implement dependency pinning and integrity checks, and use code signing for build artifacts. Implement secure CI/CD pipelines with access controls.
