## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize HTML Content for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_html_content_for__dangerouslysetinnerhtml_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all React components** using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop. This prop in React bypasses React's built-in XSS protection by directly injecting raw HTML into the DOM.
    2.  **Choose and integrate an HTML sanitization library** within your React project. DOMPurify is a recommended library. Install it using npm or yarn (e.g., `npm install dompurify`).
    3.  **Import the sanitization library** into each React component where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used.
    4.  **Before passing HTML to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, sanitize it using the chosen library.** For example, in a React component:
        ```javascript
        import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

        function MyComponent({ unsafeHTML }) {
          const sanitizedHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(unsafeHTML);
          return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: sanitizedHTML }} />;
        }
        ```
    5.  **Configure the sanitization library** to allow only necessary HTML tags and attributes, removing potentially harmful ones like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, and event handlers. Refer to the library's documentation for configuration options.
    6.  **Maintain and update the sanitization library** regularly to ensure it has the latest security patches and sanitization rules.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` - High Severity:**  Directly mitigates XSS vulnerabilities that arise when using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render unsanitized HTML.  Without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers, leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS Mitigation - High Impact:**  Effectively eliminates the primary XSS risk associated with using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React applications, provided sanitization is implemented correctly and consistently.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:**  The `BlogPostContent` component (`src/components/BlogPostContent.jsx`) utilizes DOMPurify to sanitize blog post content before rendering it using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. This is crucial as blog content is user-generated and potentially untrusted.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:**  Ensure that any future use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` across the entire React application, in new components or features, also incorporates HTML sanitization as a standard practice.  Code reviews should specifically check for unsanitized usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable React Development Mode in Production Builds](./mitigation_strategies/disable_react_development_mode_in_production_builds.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure the React build process** to explicitly disable development mode when creating production builds. React's development mode includes debugging features and verbose error messages that are not intended for production environments.
    2.  **Verify the build configuration** (e.g., using environment variables or build scripts) to ensure that the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production` during the production build process. This is the standard way to signal to React to build in production mode.
    3.  **Test production builds in a staging environment** that mirrors the production setup to confirm that development mode is disabled. Production builds should be significantly smaller and faster than development builds, and development-specific warnings should not be present in the browser console.
    4.  **Document the production build process** clearly for all developers to follow, emphasizing the importance of disabling development mode for deployed applications.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure - Low to Medium Severity:** Prevents the exposure of potentially sensitive debugging information, detailed error messages, and React development-specific code that is included in development builds. This information could be leveraged by attackers to understand the application's structure, identify potential vulnerabilities, or gain insights into internal logic.
    *   **Performance Degradation - Low Severity:** Development mode in React introduces performance overhead for debugging and development purposes. Disabling it in production improves application performance and responsiveness for end-users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure Mitigation - Low to Medium Impact:** Reduces the risk of information leakage by removing development-specific artifacts from production builds. While not a primary security vulnerability, it minimizes the information available to potential attackers.
    *   **Performance Improvement - Low Impact:**  Improves the performance of the React application in production, leading to a better user experience.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:**  The `package.json` scripts for building the application (`npm run build`) are configured to set `NODE_ENV=production`. This ensures that when the production build command is executed, React is built in production mode.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:**  Automated checks within the CI/CD pipeline to explicitly verify that production builds are indeed built with `NODE_ENV=production`. This could involve inspecting build artifacts or running tests against a production build to confirm development mode features are absent. Regular reviews of build configurations are also recommended to prevent accidental re-enabling of development mode in production.
