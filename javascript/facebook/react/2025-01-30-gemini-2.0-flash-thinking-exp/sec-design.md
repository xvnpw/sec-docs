# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable developers to build user interfaces efficiently and effectively.
  - Provide a declarative and component-based approach to UI development.
  - Foster a large and active community around the library.
  - Ensure high performance and responsiveness of user interfaces built with React.
  - Maintain and improve the library to meet evolving web development needs.
  - Promote wide adoption of React across various platforms and applications.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the React library could impact a vast number of applications.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting React's dependencies or build process could compromise the library.
  - Performance issues in React could lead to negative user experiences and developer dissatisfaction.
  - Lack of community support or decline in contributions could hinder the library's development and adoption.
  - Changes in web standards or browser technologies could render React obsolete or require significant rework.
  - Misuse of React by developers leading to insecure or poorly performing applications, reflecting negatively on the library's reputation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are performed by maintainers and community members (described in GitHub contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Automated testing including unit and integration tests (implemented in GitHub Actions workflows).
  - security control: Static analysis tools and linters are likely used during development (inferred from common JavaScript development practices).
  - security control: Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (potentially integrated into GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pipelines).
  - security control: Public vulnerability reporting process via GitHub issues and security channels (described in community guidelines).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Open source nature makes the codebase publicly accessible for vulnerability research (both beneficial and potentially risky).
  - accepted risk:  Security of applications built with React is primarily the responsibility of the application developers, not the React library itself.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement a formal security audit by a third-party security firm to identify potential vulnerabilities in the React core and build process.
  - security control: Establish a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Enhance supply chain security measures by using dependency pinning, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and signing build artifacts.
  - security control: Implement fuzz testing to discover unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in core components.
  - security control: Create and maintain security-focused documentation and guidelines for developers using React to build secure applications.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to React library itself. Authentication is handled by applications built with React and backend services.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to React library itself. Authorization is handled by applications built with React and backend services.
  - Input Validation: React primarily deals with rendering data, not direct user input handling. Input validation is the responsibility of application developers using React, especially when handling data from external sources or user inputs within React components. React's virtual DOM and JSX help prevent some forms of DOM-based XSS by default, but developers must still be cautious with dynamic content rendering.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to React library itself. Cryptographic operations are handled by applications built with React when needed, using browser APIs or external libraries. React should not introduce any cryptographic vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Developer adoption and usage of React: A security vulnerability in React could severely impact developer trust and adoption, hindering its primary business goal.
  - Security of applications built with React: While React itself is a library, its security directly impacts the security of countless applications built upon it. Widespread vulnerabilities could lead to widespread application vulnerabilities.
  - Community trust and contribution: Security incidents can erode community trust and reduce contributions, impacting the long-term health and evolution of React.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of React: Highly sensitive. Compromise could lead to supply chain attacks, intellectual property theft, and loss of competitive advantage (though React is open source, integrity is crucial).
  - Build artifacts (npm packages): Highly sensitive. Compromise could lead to distribution of malware to millions of developers and applications.
  - Developer and contributor accounts: Moderately sensitive. Compromise could lead to unauthorized code changes or malicious package releases.
  - Vulnerability reports: Moderately sensitive. Premature disclosure could be exploited by attackers before patches are available.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific security scanning tools are currently used in the React build process?
  - Is there a formal process for handling and triaging security vulnerability reports?
  - Are there any specific security compliance requirements that React project needs to adhere to?
  - What is the process for security patching and releasing updates for React in case of vulnerabilities?
  - Are there any existing security awareness training programs for React developers and contributors?

- Assumptions:
  - React project uses GitHub Actions for its CI/CD pipeline.
  - React packages are published to the npm registry.
  - Security is a high priority for the React project maintainers and community.
  - The primary use case for React is building web applications, although React Native is also a significant part of the ecosystem.
  - The target audience for this document is someone involved in threat modeling for systems that depend on or are built with React.
