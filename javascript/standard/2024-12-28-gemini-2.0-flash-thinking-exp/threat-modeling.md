*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack via Compromised `standard` Dependency
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a dependency of the `standard` package itself, injecting malicious code that gets included in projects using `standard`.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malware or backdoors into the application, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or supply chain attacks on downstream users.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `standard` package's dependencies (indirectly).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit the project's dependency tree, including `standard`'s dependencies.
        *   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Consider using dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to `standard` and its dependencies.
