- **Vulnerability Name:** Unpinned GitHub Actions Versions in CI/CD Pipeline

  - **Description:**  
    The repository’s CI/CD workflows (found in the files `create-release.yml` and `deploy.yml`) reference GitHub Actions using floating version tags (for example, `actions/checkout@v2`, `actions/setup-node@v2`, `actions/create-release@v1`, and `actions/upload-release-asset@v1`). Because these tags are not pinned to a specific commit SHA, an attacker who is able to compromise one of these upstream actions (or cause a malicious update on its branch) could have their code executed during the build and release process. In practice, an attacker could:
    1. Identify that the workflows use unpinned, floating tags.
    2. Exploit a vulnerability—or compromise the upstream repository—that causes a malicious commit to be published under the same version tag.
    3. Trigger a build (for example, by pushing a tag or through a pull request in a fork that is eventually merged) so that the runner pulls the now–compromised action.
    4. Have the malicious action execute arbitrary commands during the packaging or deployment phase, leading to a compromised VSIX package.
    
  - **Impact:**  
    If this vulnerability is exploited, the attacker can inject arbitrary code into the build pipeline. The resultant malicious extension released to end users could lead to arbitrary code execution on users’ systems, compromise user data, and undermine the overall trust in the extension. Although a theme package might seem benign, the build process is part of the supply chain; a compromised CI/CD pipeline can be a high–impact attack vector.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:**  
    High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    There are no specific mitigations in place within the workflows. The actions are referenced solely by their major version tags (e.g., `v2` or `v1`) rather than exact commit SHAs. No additional integrity verification steps (such as digital signature checks) are used.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • Pin each GitHub Action to a specific commit SHA instead of a floating version tag.  
    • Consider using additional checks (for example, verifying the integrity or digital signature of downloaded actions) or approved, internally vetted actions.  
    • Regularly review and monitor the upstream actions for any updates or changes that could impact security.

  - **Preconditions:**  
    • The project’s CI/CD pipelines are triggered by events (for example, pushes or tag creations) to the publicly available repository.  
    • An upstream GitHub Action that is referenced by a floating tag becomes compromised (or a malicious update is introduced).  
    • The build environment has network access and automatically pulls the latest version available for that tag during a run.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    • In `/code/.github/workflows/create-release.yml` the workflow contains steps such as:  
  - `- uses: actions/checkout@v2`  
  - `- uses: actions/setup-node@v2`  
  - `- uses: actions/create-release@v1`  
  - `- uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1`  
    • These steps are specified with major version tags only. When the workflow is executed, each step downloads the latest commit from the corresponding branch (e.g., the latest commit reachable via the `v2` tag`).  
    • In `/code/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` the same pattern is observed with actions such as `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/setup-node@v2`.  
    • A visual flow of the vulnerability is as follows:  
  [Build Trigger] → [Workflow reads action step using floating tag] → [Upstream action repository publishes a malicious commit under that tag] → [Compromised action code is downloaded during build] → [Malicious payload injected into VSIX package]
    
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Preparation:**  
       - Fork the repository so that you can modify and test the CI/CD pipeline in a controlled environment.  
       - In your fork, simulate a “compromised” action by temporarily modifying one of the workflow steps to point to a deliberately vulnerable or modified version (for testing purposes only). For example, replace an action reference with one pointing to a custom repository containing a script that prints or executes a distinct marker command.
    2. **Execution:**  
       - Push a commit or tag that would trigger the workflow (for instance, simulate a release by pushing a tag that matches `v*` as expected by the workflow trigger).  
       - Monitor the GitHub Actions build logs.  
    3. **Observation:**  
       - Verify that the runner downloads the action using the floating tag and that your modified “compromised” version is executed by checking for your unique marker message or unexpected command execution output in the build logs.
    4. **Conclusion:**  
       - If the test confirms that the floating version of a GitHub Action leads to execution of the unintended payload, document your findings. This will prove that the unpinned actions setting constitutes a real-life supply chain vulnerability that could be exploited by an external actor if upstream repositories are compromised.
