### Key Attack Surfaces in Egg.js Applications (High & Critical, Directly Involving Egg)

**I. Route Parameter Injection:**

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters to access unintended resources or trigger unexpected application behavior.
*   **How Egg Contributes:** Egg.js's dynamic routing system relies on extracting parameters from URLs (`ctx.params`). If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized, they can be used maliciously.
*   **Example:** A route like `/users/:id` might be exploited by accessing `/users/../admin` if the application doesn't validate the `id` parameter, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all route parameters.
    *   Use regular expressions in route definitions to restrict parameter formats.
    *   Employ whitelisting of allowed parameter values.
    *   Avoid directly using route parameters in file system operations or database queries without validation.

**II. Middleware Vulnerabilities (Custom Middleware):**

*   **Description:** Security flaws exist within custom middleware developed for the Egg.js application.
*   **How Egg Contributes:** Egg.js's middleware system allows developers to intercept and process requests. Vulnerabilities in custom middleware directly expose the application.
*   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware might have a logic flaw allowing bypass with a specific header or cookie value.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization failures, information disclosure, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of all custom middleware.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing middleware.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in middleware logic.
    *   Consider using well-vetted, community-maintained middleware where possible.

**III. Exposure of Sensitive Configuration:**

*   **Description:** Sensitive information stored in configuration files is unintentionally exposed.
*   **How Egg Contributes:** Egg.js uses configuration files (`config/config.*.js`) to manage application settings. If these files are not properly secured or contain sensitive data, they become targets.
*   **Example:** Database credentials, API keys, or secret keys stored in `config.default.js` are accidentally committed to a public repository or accessible through misconfigured server settings.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and associated resources, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store sensitive configuration data using environment variables instead of directly in configuration files.
    *   Use configuration management tools designed for secrets management.
    *   Ensure proper access controls on configuration files in the deployment environment.
    *   Avoid committing sensitive information to version control systems.

**IV. Third-Party Plugin Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within plugins used by the Egg.js application.
*   **How Egg Contributes:** Egg.js's plugin system allows extending functionality. Vulnerabilities in these third-party plugins directly impact the application's security.
*   **Example:** A popular authentication plugin has a known vulnerability that allows bypassing authentication.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the plugin's functionality, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet all third-party plugins before using them.
    *   Keep all plugins up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories for used plugins.
    *   Consider the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to plugins.

**V. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Rendered Views:**

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **How Egg Contributes:** If data passed to the view engine is not properly sanitized or escaped, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities when the view is rendered.
*   **Example:** User-provided input is displayed directly in a view without escaping, allowing an attacker to inject JavaScript that steals cookies or redirects users.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and escape user-provided data before rendering it in views.
    *   Utilize the built-in escaping mechanisms provided by the view engine.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
