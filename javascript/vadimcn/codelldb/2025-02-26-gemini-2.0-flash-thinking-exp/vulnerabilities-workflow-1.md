## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Webview Panels

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Webview Panels

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious HTML string containing JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
    2. The attacker influences a Python script running within CodeLLDB to pass this malicious HTML string to the `display_html` or `create_webview` API functions. This can be achieved by:
        - Setting a variable in the debuggee program to contain the malicious HTML.
        - Using a Python script in CodeLLDB to evaluate this variable and pass its value to `display_html` or `create_webview`.
    3. CodeLLDB's Python API sends this unsanitized HTML content to the frontend (VSCode) to be rendered in a webview panel.
    4. VSCode renders the webview panel, executing the embedded JavaScript code from the malicious HTML.

- **Impact:**
    Successful XSS can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the VSCode webview panel. This can lead to:
    - Information disclosure: Access to sensitive data within the VSCode workspace, including source code, environment variables, tokens, and other workspace-related information.
    - Session hijacking: Potential to hijack the user's VSCode session or gain control over the VSCode environment.
    - Malicious actions: Ability to perform actions within VSCode on behalf of the user, potentially installing malicious extensions, modifying files, or exfiltrating data.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No HTML sanitization is implemented in the `display_html` or `create_webview` functions or in the message handling pipeline. Raw HTML content is directly passed to the frontend.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    HTML sanitization must be implemented in the `display_html` and `create_webview` functions within `adapter/scripts/codelldb/api.py`. Input HTML strings should be sanitized before being sent to the frontend for rendering. Consider using a robust HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must be able to execute Python scripts within the CodeLLDB debugger (standard functionality).
    2. The user must be able to influence or control the content of an HTML string that is subsequently passed to the `display_html` or `create_webview` API. This could be achieved by manipulating variables in the debuggee program or by directly crafting malicious HTML within a Python script executed in the debugger console.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. `adapter/scripts/codelldb/api.py`: The `display_html(html: str, ...)` and `create_webview(...)` functions are defined. Both take an `html` string argument, which represents the HTML content to be displayed in the webview.
    2. `adapter/scripts/codelldb/webview.py`: The `Webview` class handles the communication with the frontend for webview panels. The `set_html(self, html: str)` method in this class directly sends the provided `html` string via a `webviewSetHtml` message to the frontend without any sanitization or encoding of the HTML content.
    3. `adapter/scripts/codelldb/interface.py`: The `send_message` function is used to transmit messages to the frontend. It serializes the message body (which includes the unsanitized HTML) into JSON and sends it. No sanitization is performed at this stage.
    4. No other files in the provided project files appear to implement any HTML sanitization for the `display_html` or `create_webview` features.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a C++ program named `xss_test.cpp` with the following code:
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    int main() {
        std::string malicious_html = "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>";
        std::cout << "Ready to debug" << std::endl;
        int x = 0;
        std::cin >> x; // Set breakpoint on this line
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    2. Compile `xss_test.cpp` to create an executable (e.g., `xss_test`).
    3. Open VSCode, create a new project or open an existing one, and add the `xss_test.cpp` file.
    4. Create a launch configuration in `launch.json` for debugging `xss_test`.
    5. Start a debug session for the `xss_test` program. Set a breakpoint at the line `std::cin >> x;`.
    6. Once the breakpoint is hit, open the Debug Console in VSCode.
    7. Execute the following Python script command in the Debug Console:
    ```python
    import debugger
    malicious_html_value = debugger.evaluate("malicious_html")
    if malicious_html_value:
        malicious_html = malicious_html_value.GetValue()
        if malicious_html:
            debugger.display_html(malicious_html, title="XSS Test")
        else:
            print("malicious_html value is empty.")
    else:
        print("Could not evaluate malicious_html.")
    ```
    8. Observe if a webview panel named "XSS Test" appears, and if an alert dialog box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" is displayed within the webview.
    9. If the alert dialog appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.

### 2. Unauthenticated RPC Server Allows Arbitrary Debug Configuration Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated RPC Server Allows Arbitrary Debug Configuration Injection

- **Description:**
    1. The operator deploys a CodeLLDB instance with RPC server enabled (via the `"lldb.rpcServer"` workspace setting) without enforcing a strong token.
    2. An attacker connects (using a tool such as netcat) to the exposed RPC server’s host/port.
    3. The attacker sends a malicious JSON payload—for example, one that includes a `preRunCommands` array with a command to execute an arbitrary system command.
    4. Upon receiving the half–closed connection, the adapter processes the configuration and executes the injected commands.

- **Impact:**
    An attacker can force the debugger to execute arbitrary pre–launch or post–launch commands. This may lead to full remote code execution with the privileges of the debug adapter process and lead to data exfiltration, further compromise, or lateral movement.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The MANUAL.md documentation mentions that a token parameter may be set in the RPC server configuration to restrict access. This measure is optional and not enforced by default.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no mandatory access control or robust authentication mechanism on the RPC endpoint.
    - The design relies solely on an optional token—with no server–side validation seen in the source code—which leaves the endpoint vulnerable if misconfigured.
    - There is no input sanitization or further validation on the submitted debug configurations.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The workspace settings must enable the RPC server (via `"lldb.rpcServer"`).
    - The machine running CodeLLDB must be reachable (or misconfigured to expose the RPC port publicly).
    - No token (or a weak one) is provided in the configuration.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability is described entirely in the documentation (MANUAL.md’s “RPC Server” section) and is not countered in code.
    - There is no visible code that enforces token matching or further checks on the JSON debug configuration submitted by external clients.
    - As a result, if an RPC server instance is configured without proper restrictions, any connection can supply a debug configuration that is executed verbatim.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Configure a CodeLLDB instance with an enabled RPC server in the workspace settings without supplying a token.
    2. From an external machine, open a TCP connection to the specified host and port (for example, using:
       ```
       nc <host> <port>
       ```
       ).
    3. Send a JSON payload such as:
       ```
       { "program": "/bin/ls", "preRunCommands": ["system('touch /tmp/pwned')"] }
       ```
    4. Close the connection (half–close, as described in the documentation).
    5. Verify on the host that the command was executed (for example, by checking that the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created).
    6. Document the results and capture network traces to demonstrate the arbitrary configuration injection.

### 3. Python Code Injection via Debug Console Expressions

- **Vulnerability Name:** Python Code Injection via Debug Console Expressions

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains access to a VS Code debug session using CodeLLDB.
    2. The attacker opens the Debug Console panel.
    3. The attacker enters a Python expression prefixed with `/py ` (e.g., `/py import os; os.system('calc.exe')`).
    4. The CodeLLDB extension interprets this input as a Python expression to be evaluated.
    5. The extension's backend compiles and executes the provided Python code without proper sanitization.
    6. The attacker-controlled Python code is executed within the context of the CodeLLDB extension.

- **Impact:** Critical. Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control over the user's system, allowing for data theft, malware installation, or further system compromise.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The project does not implement any input validation or sanitization for Python expressions entered in the debug console. The documentation does not warn users about the security risks associated with using Python expressions in the debug console.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for Python expressions entered in the debug console to prevent the execution of arbitrary code. Consider using a safe evaluation environment or a restricted subset of Python.
    - **Disable Python Expressions by Default:**  Disable the "python" expression evaluator by default, or at least provide a prominent warning to users about the security implications of enabling it.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Python expression evaluation in a sandboxed environment with minimal privileges to limit the impact of potential code injection vulnerabilities.
    - **User Warning:** Display a clear warning message in the documentation and within VS Code itself about the security risks of using Python expressions, especially when debugging untrusted code.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have access to a debug session in VS Code using the CodeLLDB extension. This could be through social engineering, by compromising a developer's workspace, or in scenarios where users debug code from untrusted sources.
    - The user must interact with the Debug Console and be persuaded or tricked into entering a malicious Python expression, or unknowingly execute a command that includes a malicious Python expression.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`adapter/scripts/codelldb/interface.py:compile_code`**: This function receives a string `expr_ptr` containing the Python expression from the Rust backend. It uses the built-in Python `compile()` function to compile this string into executable code:
    ```python
    @CFUNCTYPE(c_bool, POINTER(PyObjectResult), POINTER(c_char), c_size_t, POINTER(c_char), c_size_t)
    def compile_code(result, expr_ptr, expr_len, POINTER(c_char), filename_len):
        try:
            expr = ctypes.string_at(expr_ptr, expr_len)
            filename = ctypes.string_at(filename_ptr, filename_len)
            try:
                pycode = compile(expr, filename, 'eval') # Vulnerable point: No sanitization before compilation
            except SyntaxError:
                pycode = compile(expr, filename, 'exec')
            incref(pycode)
            result[0] = PyObjectResult.Ok(pycode)
        except Exception as err:
            error = lldb.SBError()
            error.SetErrorString(traceback.format_exc())
            error = from_swig_wrapper(error, RustSBError)
            result[0] = PyObjectResult.Err(error)
        return True
    ```
    No input sanitization or validation is performed on the `expr` before it is compiled.

    2. **`adapter/scripts/codelldb/interface.py:evaluate_as_sbvalue` and `evaluate_as_bool`**: These functions receive the compiled Python code `pycode` and execute it using `eval(code, eval_globals)`:
    ```python
    @CFUNCTYPE(c_bool, POINTER(ValueResult), py_object, RustSBExecutionContext, c_int)
    def evaluate_as_sbvalue(result, pycode, exec_context, eval_context):
        '''Evaluate code in the context specified by SBExecutionContext, and return a SBValue result'''
        try:
            exec_context = into_swig_wrapper(exec_context, RustSBExecutionContext)
            value = evaluate_in_context(pycode, exec_context, eval_context) # Vulnerable point: Execution of unsanitized code
            value = to_sbvalue(value, exec_context.GetTarget())
            result[0] = ValueResult.Ok(from_swig_wrapper(value, RustSBValue))
        except Exception as err:
            error = lldb.SBError()
            error = from_swig_wrapper(error, RustSBError)
            result[0] = ValueResult.Err(error)
        return True
    ```
    Again, no security checks are performed before executing the compiled code. This allows arbitrary Python code to be executed if an attacker can control the input expression.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open VS Code with the CodeLLDB extension installed and enabled.
    2. Create or open any debuggable project (e.g., a simple "Hello World" C++ or Rust project).
    3. Start a debug session for the project.
    4. Once the debug session is active, open the "Debug Console" panel in VS Code (View -> Debug Console).
    5. In the Debug Console input field, type the following command to inject and execute Python code that launches the calculator application (for Windows):
    ```
    /py import os; os.system('calc.exe')
    ```
    Or, for Linux/macOS (assuming `xcalc` is installed):
    ```
    /py import os; os.system('xcalc')
    ```
    6. Press Enter to execute the command.
    7. **Expected Result:** Observe that the calculator application (`calc.exe` on Windows or `xcalc` on Linux/macOS) is launched. This demonstrates successful arbitrary code execution within the CodeLLDB extension context, confirming the Python code injection vulnerability.
    8. **Note:** For a more benign test, you can use `/py print("Vulnerable!")` which should print "Vulnerable!" in the Debug Console, confirming Python execution.
