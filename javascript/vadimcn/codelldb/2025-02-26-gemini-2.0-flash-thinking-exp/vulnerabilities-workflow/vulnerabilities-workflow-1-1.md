### Vulnerability 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Webview Panels

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Webview Panels
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious HTML string containing JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
    2. The attacker influences a Python script running within CodeLLDB to pass this malicious HTML string to the `display_html` or `create_webview` API functions. This can be achieved by:
        - Setting a variable in the debuggee program to contain the malicious HTML.
        - Using a Python script in CodeLLDB to evaluate this variable and pass its value to `display_html` or `create_webview`.
    3. CodeLLDB's Python API sends this unsanitized HTML content to the frontend (VSCode) to be rendered in a webview panel.
    4. VSCode renders the webview panel, executing the embedded JavaScript code from the malicious HTML.
* Impact:
    Successful XSS can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the VSCode webview panel. This can lead to:
    - Information disclosure: Access to sensitive data within the VSCode workspace, including source code, environment variables, tokens, and other workspace-related information.
    - Session hijacking: Potential to hijack the user's VSCode session or gain control over the VSCode environment.
    - Malicious actions: Ability to perform actions within VSCode on behalf of the user, potentially installing malicious extensions, modifying files, or exfiltrating data.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No HTML sanitization is implemented in the `display_html` or `create_webview` functions or in the message handling pipeline. Raw HTML content is directly passed to the frontend.
* Missing Mitigations:
    HTML sanitization must be implemented in the `display_html` and `create_webview` functions within `adapter/scripts/codelldb/api.py`. Input HTML strings should be sanitized before being sent to the frontend for rendering. Consider using a robust HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify.
* Preconditions:
    1. The user must be able to execute Python scripts within the CodeLLDB debugger (standard functionality).
    2. The user must be able to influence or control the content of an HTML string that is subsequently passed to the `display_html` or `create_webview` API. This could be achieved by manipulating variables in the debuggee program or by directly crafting malicious HTML within a Python script executed in the debugger console.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. `adapter/scripts/codelldb/api.py`: The `display_html(html: str, ...)` and `create_webview(...)` functions are defined. Both take an `html` string argument, which represents the HTML content to be displayed in the webview.
    2. `adapter/scripts/codelldb/webview.py`: The `Webview` class handles the communication with the frontend for webview panels. The `set_html(self, html: str)` method in this class directly sends the provided `html` string via a `webviewSetHtml` message to the frontend without any sanitization or encoding of the HTML content.
    3. `adapter/scripts/codelldb/interface.py`: The `send_message` function is used to transmit messages to the frontend. It serializes the message body (which includes the unsanitized HTML) into JSON and sends it. No sanitization is performed at this stage.
    4. No other files in the provided project files appear to implement any HTML sanitization for the `display_html` or `create_webview` features.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a C++ program named `xss_test.cpp` with the following code:
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    int main() {
        std::string malicious_html = "<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>";
        std::cout << "Ready to debug" << std::endl;
        int x = 0;
        std::cin >> x; // Set breakpoint on this line
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    2. Compile `xss_test.cpp` to create an executable (e.g., `xss_test`).
    3. Open VSCode, create a new project or open an existing one, and add the `xss_test.cpp` file.
    4. Create a launch configuration in `launch.json` for debugging `xss_test`.
    5. Start a debug session for the `xss_test` program. Set a breakpoint at the line `std::cin >> x;`.
    6. Once the breakpoint is hit, open the Debug Console in VSCode.
    7. Execute the following Python script command in the Debug Console:
    ```python
    import debugger
    malicious_html_value = debugger.evaluate("malicious_html")
    if malicious_html_value:
        malicious_html = malicious_html_value.GetValue()
        if malicious_html:
            debugger.display_html(malicious_html, title="XSS Test")
        else:
            print("malicious_html value is empty.")
    else:
        print("Could not evaluate malicious_html.")
    ```
    8. Observe if a webview panel named "XSS Test" appears, and if an alert dialog box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" is displayed within the webview.
    9. If the alert dialog appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.
