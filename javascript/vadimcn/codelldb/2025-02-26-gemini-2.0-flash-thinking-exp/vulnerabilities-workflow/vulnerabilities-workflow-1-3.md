## Vulnerability List

### 1. Python Code Injection via Debug Console Expressions

- **Vulnerability Name:** Python Code Injection via Debug Console Expressions
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains access to a VS Code debug session using CodeLLDB.
    2. The attacker opens the Debug Console panel.
    3. The attacker enters a Python expression prefixed with `/py ` (e.g., `/py import os; os.system('calc.exe')`).
    4. The CodeLLDB extension interprets this input as a Python expression to be evaluated.
    5. The extension's backend compiles and executes the provided Python code without proper sanitization.
    6. The attacker-controlled Python code is executed within the context of the CodeLLDB extension.
- **Impact:** Critical. Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control over the user's system, allowing for data theft, malware installation, or further system compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The project does not implement any input validation or sanitization for Python expressions entered in the debug console. The documentation does not warn users about the security risks associated with using Python expressions in the debug console.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for Python expressions entered in the debug console to prevent the execution of arbitrary code. Consider using a safe evaluation environment or a restricted subset of Python.
    - **Disable Python Expressions by Default:**  Disable the "python" expression evaluator by default, or at least provide a prominent warning to users about the security implications of enabling it.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Python expression evaluation in a sandboxed environment with minimal privileges to limit the impact of potential code injection vulnerabilities.
    - **User Warning:** Display a clear warning message in the documentation and within VS Code itself about the security risks of using Python expressions, especially when debugging untrusted code.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have access to a debug session in VS Code using the CodeLLDB extension. This could be through social engineering, by compromising a developer's workspace, or in scenarios where users debug code from untrusted sources.
    - The user must interact with the Debug Console and be persuaded or tricked into entering a malicious Python expression, or unknowingly execute a command that includes a malicious Python expression.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`adapter/scripts/codelldb/interface.py:compile_code`**: This function receives a string `expr_ptr` containing the Python expression from the Rust backend. It uses the built-in Python `compile()` function to compile this string into executable code:
    ```python
    @CFUNCTYPE(c_bool, POINTER(PyObjectResult), POINTER(c_char), c_size_t, POINTER(c_char), c_size_t)
    def compile_code(result, expr_ptr, expr_len, POINTER(c_char), filename_len):
        try:
            expr = ctypes.string_at(expr_ptr, expr_len)
            filename = ctypes.string_at(filename_ptr, filename_len)
            try:
                pycode = compile(expr, filename, 'eval') # Vulnerable point: No sanitization before compilation
            except SyntaxError:
                pycode = compile(expr, filename, 'exec')
            incref(pycode)
            result[0] = PyObjectResult.Ok(pycode)
        except Exception as err:
            error = lldb.SBError()
            error.SetErrorString(traceback.format_exc())
            error = from_swig_wrapper(error, RustSBError)
            result[0] = PyObjectResult.Err(error)
        return True
    ```
    No input sanitization or validation is performed on the `expr` before it is compiled.

    2. **`adapter/scripts/codelldb/interface.py:evaluate_as_sbvalue` and `evaluate_as_bool`**: These functions receive the compiled Python code `pycode` and execute it using `eval(code, eval_globals)`:
    ```python
    @CFUNCTYPE(c_bool, POINTER(ValueResult), py_object, RustSBExecutionContext, c_int)
    def evaluate_as_sbvalue(result, pycode, exec_context, eval_context):
        '''Evaluate code in the context specified by SBExecutionContext, and return a SBValue result'''
        try:
            exec_context = into_swig_wrapper(exec_context, RustSBExecutionContext)
            value = evaluate_in_context(pycode, exec_context, eval_context) # Vulnerable point: Execution of unsanitized code
            value = to_sbvalue(value, exec_context.GetTarget())
            result[0] = ValueResult.Ok(from_swig_wrapper(value, RustSBValue))
        except Exception as err:
            error = lldb.SBError()
            error = from_swig_wrapper(error, RustSBError)
            result[0] = ValueResult.Err(error)
        return True
    ```
    Again, no security checks are performed before executing the compiled code. This allows arbitrary Python code to be executed if an attacker can control the input expression.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open VS Code with the CodeLLDB extension installed and enabled.
    2. Create or open any debuggable project (e.g., a simple "Hello World" C++ or Rust project).
    3. Start a debug session for the project.
    4. Once the debug session is active, open the "Debug Console" panel in VS Code (View -> Debug Console).
    5. In the Debug Console input field, type the following command to inject and execute Python code that launches the calculator application (for Windows):
    ```
    /py import os; os.system('calc.exe')
    ```
    Or, for Linux/macOS (assuming `xcalc` is installed):
    ```
    /py import os; os.system('xcalc')
    ```
    6. Press Enter to execute the command.
    7. **Expected Result:** Observe that the calculator application (`calc.exe` on Windows or `xcalc` on Linux/macOS) is launched. This demonstrates successful arbitrary code execution within the CodeLLDB extension context, confirming the Python code injection vulnerability.
    8. **Note:** For a more benign test, you can use `/py print("Vulnerable!")` which should print "Vulnerable!" in the Debug Console, confirming Python execution.
