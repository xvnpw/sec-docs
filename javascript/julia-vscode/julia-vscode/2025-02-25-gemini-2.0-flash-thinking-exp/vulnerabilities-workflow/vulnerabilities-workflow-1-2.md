Based on the provided vulnerability assessment and your instructions, no vulnerabilities meet the criteria for inclusion in the updated list.

The assessment explicitly states:

- **No new high‑severity vulnerabilities were identified.**
- **Vulnerability Rank: N/A (no high‐severity or critical vulnerabilities identified)**

Since there are no vulnerabilities identified with a rank of "high" or "critical", and the assessment concludes the project's security posture is robust in the areas reviewed (manifest and project configuration files), there are no vulnerabilities to list that meet your inclusion criteria.

Therefore, the updated vulnerability list is empty.
