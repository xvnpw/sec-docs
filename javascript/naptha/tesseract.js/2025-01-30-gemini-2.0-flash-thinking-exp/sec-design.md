# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, tesseract.js, aims to provide Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities directly within web browsers. This eliminates the need for server-side OCR processing, offering benefits like reduced latency, offline functionality, and potentially lower infrastructure costs for applications that require client-side OCR.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enable client-side OCR functionality for web applications.
- Provide an easy-to-integrate JavaScript library for OCR.
- Offer a performant and reasonably accurate OCR solution in the browser environment.
- Reduce reliance on server-side OCR services for certain use cases.

Business Risks:
- Data privacy concerns related to processing potentially sensitive image data within the user's browser.
- Accuracy limitations of client-side OCR compared to more powerful server-side solutions.
- Performance impact on client devices, especially lower-powered ones.
- Security vulnerabilities within the tesseract.js library itself, potentially exposing user data or devices.
- Dependence on browser capabilities and compatibility across different browsers and versions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Project - The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the code. Implemented: GITHUB REPOSITORY.
- security control: Publicly Available Code - The source code is publicly accessible on GitHub, promoting transparency. Implemented: GITHUB REPOSITORY.
- security control: npm Package - Distributed as an npm package, leveraging the npm ecosystem for distribution and versioning. Implemented: NPM REGISTRY.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Client-Side Processing - Image processing happens within the user's browser, which inherently carries some level of risk as the execution environment is less controlled than a server environment.
- accepted risk: Dependency on Browser Security - Relies on the security features and policies of web browsers to protect user data and the execution environment.

Recommended Security Controls:
- recommended security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by tesseract.js.
- recommended security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically analyze the tesseract.js codebase for potential security flaws.
- recommended security control: Input Validation Guidance - Provide clear documentation and best practices for developers on how to properly handle and validate image inputs to prevent potential injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
- recommended security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by security experts to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities in the library.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable as tesseract.js is a client-side library and does not handle user authentication itself. Applications using tesseract.js will need to implement their own authentication mechanisms if required.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to tesseract.js library itself. Authorization will be the responsibility of the web application integrating tesseract.js to control access to OCR functionality and processed data.
- Input Validation: Crucial for tesseract.js. The library needs to be robust against malformed or malicious image inputs to prevent crashes, unexpected behavior, or potential security exploits. Input validation should be performed on image data before processing.
- Cryptography: While not directly core to OCR functionality, cryptography might be relevant if tesseract.js is used in contexts where processed text or intermediate data needs to be protected. Consider if encryption is needed for sensitive data handling within applications using tesseract.js, but this is likely outside the scope of the library itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing client-side OCR functionality to web applications.
- Maintaining the usability and performance of web applications that rely on tesseract.js.
- Protecting the reputation and trust associated with the tesseract.js project and its maintainers.

Data to Protect:
- User Images: Images processed by tesseract.js may contain sensitive information (personal data, financial documents, etc.).
    - Sensitivity: Medium to High, depending on the context and content of the images.
- OCR Output (Extracted Text): The extracted text might also contain sensitive information derived from the images.
    - Sensitivity: Medium to High, depending on the context and content of the images.
- Language Data Files: Integrity of language data files is important for OCR accuracy and preventing malicious data injection.
    - Sensitivity: Low to Medium (Integrity is more important than confidentiality).
- Source Code: Confidentiality and integrity of the source code are important to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
    - Sensitivity: Medium (Integrity and Availability are key).
