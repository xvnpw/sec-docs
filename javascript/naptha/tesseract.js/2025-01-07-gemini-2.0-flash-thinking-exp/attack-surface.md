# Attack Surface Analysis for naptha/tesseract.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Input Leading to Image Decoder Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_input_leading_to_image_decoder_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Submitting specially crafted image files can exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoding libraries used by the browser or polyfills employed by Tesseract.js.

**How Tesseract.js Contributes:** Tesseract.js processes user-provided image data, relying on these decoding mechanisms to interpret the image before performing OCR. If a decoder has a vulnerability, Tesseract.js's use of it can expose the application.

**Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser, denial of service (browser crash), or memory corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict validation on the server-side and client-side to ensure uploaded files are indeed images and conform to expected formats.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure a strong CSP to limit the capabilities of JavaScript and prevent the execution of potentially injected malicious code.
*   **Browser Updates:** Encourage users to keep their browsers updated, as browser vendors regularly patch known vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries.
*   **Consider Server-Side Processing:** If feasible, perform image processing and OCR on the server-side to isolate the potentially vulnerable decoding process from the user's browser environment.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized OCR Output](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_ocr_output.md)

**Description:** If the text extracted by Tesseract.js is directly displayed on the webpage without proper sanitization, attackers can embed malicious scripts within the input image that will be executed in the user's browser.

**How Tesseract.js Contributes:** Tesseract.js extracts text content from images, which could potentially include malicious scripts disguised as text.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Output Encoding/Sanitization:**  Always encode or sanitize the text output from Tesseract.js before displaying it on the webpage. Use appropriate escaping mechanisms for the specific context (e.g., HTML escaping for displaying in HTML).
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to further mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Code Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/client-side_code_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Since Tesseract.js runs entirely in the client's browser, an attacker who can compromise the user's machine or inject malicious JavaScript into the page could potentially manipulate the library's code or its execution flow.

**How Tesseract.js Contributes:**  As a client-side JavaScript library, its code is directly accessible and modifiable by malicious actors with sufficient access.

**Impact:**  Data exfiltration, bypassing security checks, potential for further malicious actions within the client's browser context.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Delivery (HTTPS):** Ensure the application and all its resources, including Tesseract.js, are served over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that could inject malicious code.
*   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags for Tesseract.js and its dependencies to ensure that the browser fetches the expected, untampered versions of the files.
*   **Input Validation (Indirect):** While not directly preventing code manipulation, robust input validation can limit the attacker's ability to influence the application's behavior even if the client-side code is tampered with.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application and its dependencies.
