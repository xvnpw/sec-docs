# Threat Model Analysis for naptha/tesseract.js

## Threat: [Malicious Input Image Exploitation](./threats/malicious_input_image_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image designed to exploit vulnerabilities within Tesseract.js's image processing logic (potentially before passing to the WASM module) or within the Emscripten-compiled WASM code itself. This could involve malformed image data that triggers bugs in the underlying C++ Tesseract library exposed through WASM.
*   **Impact:**  The user's browser tab could crash (Denial of Service), become unresponsive, or in a worst-case scenario, could potentially lead to memory corruption within the WASM environment if vulnerabilities exist, although direct remote code execution from WASM in a modern browser is highly mitigated by sandboxing.
*   **Affected Component:** Tesseract.js's image loading/preprocessing logic (if any before WASM), the Emscripten-compiled WASM module (`tesseract-core.wasm.js`, `tesseract-core-simd.wasm.js`, `tesseract-core.wasm`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly processing untrusted image data without any prior checks.
    *   Keep Tesseract.js updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the underlying Tesseract engine and Emscripten compilation.
    *   Consider server-side image processing and validation as an additional layer of defense before client-side OCR, though this is outside the direct scope of Tesseract.js threats.

## Threat: [Compromised Tesseract.js Library or WASM Files](./threats/compromised_tesseract_js_library_or_wasm_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the source from which the Tesseract.js library or its associated WebAssembly (WASM) files are served (e.g., a compromised CDN or the application's server). They inject malicious code into these files. When a user loads the application, this malicious code is executed within their browser, leveraging the privileges of the Tesseract.js library.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. This allows the attacker to execute code within the security context of the web page.
*   **Affected Component:** The `tesseract.min.js` file, the `worker.min.js` file, the WASM files (`tesseract-core.wasm.js`, `tesseract-core-simd.wasm.js`, `tesseract-core.wasm`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for the Tesseract.js library and its dependencies when including them in the HTML. This ensures that the browser only loads the files if their content matches the expected hash.
    *   Host the Tesseract.js library and its dependencies from a trusted and secure source. If using a CDN, ensure the CDN provider has robust security measures.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, further limiting the impact of a compromised dependency.
