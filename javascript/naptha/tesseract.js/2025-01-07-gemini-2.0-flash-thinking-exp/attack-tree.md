**[CRITICAL] Exploit Tesseract.js Processing Vulnerabilities**
    * Trigger Denial of Service (DoS)
        * Provide Maliciously Crafted Image **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * Exploit Image Parsing Bugs
                * Cause Excessive Resource Consumption (CPU, Memory)

    * **[CRITICAL] Exploit Known Tesseract.js Vulnerabilities (If Any Exist)**
        * Utilize Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities
            * Exploit Specific Versions with Known Issues
    Attackers aim to find and exploit bugs within the core Tesseract.js library that handle image processing and OCR algorithms.
    Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including denial of service, memory corruption, or, in the worst case, remote code execution.
    This often involves deep technical knowledge of the library's internals and potentially the underlying WASM implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Less Likely, but consider WASM layer)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_remote_code_execution__rce___less_likely__but_consider_wasm_layer_.md)

**[CRITICAL] Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Less Likely, but consider WASM layer)**
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in WASM Compilation/Execution
            * Provide Input that Triggers Code Injection in WASM Module
    This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how the WebAssembly (WASM) code, which powers Tesseract.js, is compiled and executed within the browser or server environment.
    Attackers would need to craft specific input that triggers a flaw in the WASM runtime, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the target machine.
    While less common in typical web application attacks, the potential impact is critical.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Tesseract.js Vulnerabilities (If Any Exist)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_tesseract_js_vulnerabilities__if_any_exist_.md)

**[CRITICAL] Exploit Known Tesseract.js Vulnerabilities (If Any Exist)**
        * Utilize Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities
            * Exploit Specific Versions with Known Issues
    This is the exploitation of publicly disclosed security flaws in specific versions of the Tesseract.js library.
    Attackers leverage existing knowledge and potentially pre-built exploits to target applications using vulnerable versions.
    The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Tesseract.js Output Handling in Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tesseract_js_output_handling_in_application.md)

**[CRITICAL] Exploit Tesseract.js Output Handling in Application**
    * **[CRITICAL, HIGH-RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Malicious OCR Output**
        * Tesseract.js Recognizes Text that Contains Malicious Scripts
            * Application Renders Output Without Proper Sanitization
    * **[CRITICAL] Server-Side Injection through Malicious OCR Output**
        * Tesseract.js Recognizes Text that Contains Malicious Commands or Code
            * Application Uses Output in Server-Side Operations Without Validation (e.g., command execution, database queries)
    This focuses on vulnerabilities in how the application *uses* the text output generated by Tesseract.js.
    If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate this output, it can be a vector for injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Injection through Malicious OCR Output](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_injection_through_malicious_ocr_output.md)

**[CRITICAL] Server-Side Injection through Malicious OCR Output**
        * Tesseract.js Recognizes Text that Contains Malicious Commands or Code
            * Application Uses Output in Server-Side Operations Without Validation (e.g., command execution, database queries)
