Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving Tesseract.js with High or Critical risk severity:

**High & Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving Tesseract.js:**

**I. Malicious Image Processing**

*   **Description:**  A specially crafted image is processed by Tesseract.js, exploiting vulnerabilities in underlying image decoding libraries.
*   **How Tesseract.js Contributes:** Tesseract.js relies on browser-provided or polyfilled image decoding capabilities to handle various image formats before performing OCR. This dependency introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within those decoding libraries being triggered by malicious images.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PNG file with a crafted header that triggers a buffer overflow in the browser's image decoding engine when Tesseract.js attempts to process it.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (browser crash, application freeze), potentially Remote Code Execution (though less likely in modern sandboxed browsers).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate image file types and sizes before processing with Tesseract.js.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the capabilities of the application and mitigate potential exploitation.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Ensure the browser and any polyfills used for image decoding are up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Server-Side Processing (if feasible):**  Offload image processing to a server-side environment with more controlled dependencies and security measures.

**II. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Impacting Tesseract.js Functionality)**

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist in the JavaScript libraries that Tesseract.js depends on, and these vulnerabilities directly impact the functionality or security of Tesseract.js.
*   **How Tesseract.js Contributes:** Tesseract.js relies on other libraries for various functionalities. If these dependencies have known security flaws that can be triggered through Tesseract.js's usage of them, the application becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A dependency used by Tesseract.js for image manipulation has a known Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image that, when processed by Tesseract.js, triggers the vulnerable code in the dependency.
*   **Impact:**  Can range from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan the project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Keep Tesseract.js and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA tools in the development pipeline to continuously monitor and manage dependencies.

**III. Server-Side Resource Exhaustion (if Tesseract.js is used in Node.js)**

*   **Description:**  An attacker sends numerous or complex images to a server-side application using Tesseract.js, overwhelming the server's resources.
*   **How Tesseract.js Contributes:**  When used in a Node.js backend, Tesseract.js can consume significant server resources for OCR processing. Malicious actors can exploit this by sending a flood of requests directly targeting the Tesseract.js processing.
*   **Example:** An attacker scripts a bot to repeatedly upload large images to a server endpoint that directly uses Tesseract.js for OCR, causing the server to become overloaded and unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (server downtime, application unavailability).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that trigger OCR processing.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for the server-side OCR processes.
    *   **Queueing Mechanisms:** Use message queues to handle OCR requests asynchronously and prevent overwhelming the server.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate image inputs to prevent processing of excessively large or complex images.
