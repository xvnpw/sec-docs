## High-Risk & Critical Sub-Tree: Compromising Application via Tesseract.js

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Tesseract.js library or its integration.

**Sub-Tree:**

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application via Tesseract.js:**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete security failure of the application in the context of Tesseract.js usage.

*   **Exploiting Input Handling of Tesseract.js:**
    *   This node represents a critical juncture where the application's interaction with Tesseract.js begins. Vulnerabilities in how the application receives, validates, and passes image data to the library can open the door to various attacks. Successful exploitation at this node can lead to the execution of malicious code within the browser or denial of service.

*   **Exploiting Output Handling of Tesseract.js:**
    *   This node highlights the risks associated with how the application processes and utilizes the text output generated by Tesseract.js. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or encode this output, it can become a vector for injection attacks, allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts or manipulate backend systems.

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Provide Maliciously Crafted Image -> Image Parsing Vulnerability -> Exploit Buffer Overflow during Image Decoding -> Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) within Browser Context:**
    *   **Provide Maliciously Crafted Image:** Attackers can craft images specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how Tesseract.js decodes and processes image data.
    *   **Image Parsing Vulnerability in Tesseract.js:** Tesseract.js relies on image decoding libraries (often through the browser's built-in capabilities or Emscripten ports). Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be triggered by malformed image headers, incorrect color profiles, or other crafted data.
    *   **Exploit Buffer Overflow during Image Decoding:**  A buffer overflow occurs when the image decoding process writes data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
    *   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) within Browser Context:** By carefully crafting the malicious image and exploiting the buffer overflow, an attacker can potentially overwrite memory in a way that allows them to execute arbitrary code within the browser's security sandbox.

*   **Provide Maliciously Crafted Image -> Image Contains Embedded Malicious Content -> Trigger Client-Side Scripting (XSS) if Image Data is reflected unsafely:**
    *   **Provide Maliciously Crafted Image:** Attackers can craft images that, when processed or displayed by the application, can trigger unintended actions.
    *   **Image Contains Embedded Malicious Content:** While less direct for Tesseract.js itself, if the application processes the image data beyond OCR (e.g., displaying it), a malicious image could contain embedded scripts or other content.
    *   **Trigger Client-Side Scripting (XSS) if Image Data is reflected unsafely:** If the application directly reflects the image data or information derived from it (like file names or metadata) into the HTML without proper sanitization, the embedded malicious content can be executed by the user's browser, leading to XSS.

*   **Application Improperly Handles Output -> Unsafe Injection of OCR Output into HTML:**
    *   **Application Improperly Handles Output:** This refers to the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the text output generated by Tesseract.js before it's used in other parts of the application.
    *   **Unsafe Injection of OCR Output into HTML:** If the application directly inserts the OCR output into the HTML of a webpage without proper escaping or sanitization, an attacker can craft an image that, when processed by Tesseract.js, produces output containing malicious HTML or JavaScript. This malicious code will then be executed by the user's browser when they view the page, leading to XSS.

*   **Application Improperly Handles Output -> Unsafe Use of OCR Output in Backend Logic (e.g., SQL injection if used in queries):**
    *   **Application Improperly Handles Output:**  Again, this refers to the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the text output from Tesseract.js.
    *   **Unsafe Use of OCR Output in Backend Logic (e.g., SQL injection if used in queries):** If the application uses the OCR output to construct backend commands or queries (like SQL queries) without proper sanitization, an attacker can craft an image that, when processed, produces output containing malicious commands. For example, if the OCR output is directly inserted into an SQL query, it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to manipulate or extract data from the database.
