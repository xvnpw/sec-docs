### High and Critical Tesseract.js Specific Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Tesseract.js library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Image Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image designed to exploit vulnerabilities within Tesseract.js's image processing capabilities. This could involve manipulating image headers, embedding malicious data, or triggering buffer overflows during image decoding *within Tesseract.js*. The attacker might aim to cause a denial of service or potentially achieve remote code execution within the browser or Node.js environment.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential client-side or server-side code execution leading to data breaches or further compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Tesseract.js Image Processing Module (responsible for decoding and handling various image formats).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation on the image file type and size *before* processing with Tesseract.js.
        *   Keep Tesseract.js and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities *within the library*.
        *   Implement error handling to gracefully manage unexpected issues during image processing *by Tesseract.js*.

*   **Threat:** Injection Attacks via OCR Output
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts an image containing text that, when processed by Tesseract.js, produces output that can be used for injection attacks. For example, the image might contain text that, when extracted *by Tesseract.js*, forms malicious SQL queries, command-line instructions, or script tags. If this output is not properly sanitized before being used in further application logic, it can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) if the output is rendered in a web page without sanitization, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or malicious script execution on other users' browsers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Tesseract.js Core OCR Engine (responsible for generating the text output).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat the output of Tesseract.js as untrusted data.
        *   Implement robust output encoding and sanitization based on the context where the text is used (e.g., use parameterized queries for database interactions, sanitize HTML output before rendering).
        *   Apply context-aware escaping to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
