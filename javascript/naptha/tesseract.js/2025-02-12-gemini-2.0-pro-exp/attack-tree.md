## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Exploitation - Image-Based - XXE in SVG [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_exploitation_-_image-based_-_xxe_in_svg__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities in the parsing of SVG images. A crafted SVG image can include external references that, when processed, allow the attacker to read local files on the client's machine (or potentially make external requests, depending on the browser's configuration).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Exploitation - Image-Based - DoS via Large Image [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_exploitation_-_image-based_-_dos_via_large_image__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits an extremely large or computationally complex image to the Tesseract.js engine, causing excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) in the user's browser. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the application or even the entire browser unresponsive.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Exploitation - Image-Based - XXE in SVG [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_exploitation_-_image-based_-_xxe_in_svg__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to the client-side XXE vulnerability, but with potentially higher impact. A crafted SVG image can be used to read files on the *server*, potentially including sensitive configuration files or data. It can also be used to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), making requests from the server's context to internal or external resources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Exploitation - Image-Based - DoS via Large Image [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_exploitation_-_image-based_-_dos_via_large_image__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to the client-side DoS, but targets the server.  A large or complex image can consume server resources, potentially crashing the server process or making the application unavailable to other users.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Exploitation - WASM Module - Memory Corruption / DoS [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_exploitation_-_wasm_module_-_memory_corruption__dos__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits vulnerabilities within the WebAssembly (WASM) module used by Tesseract.js. These vulnerabilities could be in the WASM code itself (compiled from C/C++) or in the WASM runtime provided by the browser or Node.js environment.  Successful exploitation could lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution or causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Exploitation - Leptonica [CN] - Vulnerabilities in Lib [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_exploitation_-_leptonica__cn__-_vulnerabilities_in_lib__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits vulnerabilities within the Leptonica image processing library, a direct dependency of Tesseract.js.  Crafted image inputs could trigger these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service on the server or client, depending on where Tesseract.js is being used.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
