# Attack Surface Analysis for naptha/tesseract.js

## Attack Surface: [Image Parsing Exploits](./attack_surfaces/image_parsing_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Tesseract (the underlying C++ engine) parses and processes image files (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP, etc.).
*   **tesseract.js Contribution:**  `tesseract.js` bundles and executes the Tesseract engine via WebAssembly, directly exposing these parsing vulnerabilities to web applications.  This is the *primary* attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malformed JPEG image with an embedded exploit that triggers a buffer overflow in Tesseract's image decoding library.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the WebAssembly sandbox; potential for sandbox escape (though less likely). Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the worker.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability and browser security).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Update:** Keep `tesseract.js` updated to the latest version to include the newest Tesseract engine patches.  This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Pre-Validation:**  Implement robust image validation *before* passing to `tesseract.js`.  Check file type, dimensions, and size. Use a dedicated image processing library (e.g., Sharp, Jimp) for sanitization and resizing.  This adds a crucial layer of defense.
    *   **Worker Isolation:** Ensure `tesseract.js` runs in a dedicated Web Worker (default behavior).
    *   **CSP:** Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict Web Worker capabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Trained Data Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_trained_data_files.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in how Tesseract loads and processes `.traineddata` files (language models).
*   **tesseract.js Contribution:** `tesseract.js` directly loads and uses these `.traineddata` files, making the application vulnerable if a malicious file is used. This is a *direct* attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a crafted `.traineddata` file that, when loaded, triggers a vulnerability in Tesseract's data processing logic.
*   **Impact:** RCE within the WebAssembly sandbox; potential for sandbox escape (less likely). DoS.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Sources:** *Only* use `.traineddata` files from the official Tesseract repository or other highly trusted sources.  This is paramount.
    *   **No User Uploads:**  *Never* allow users to upload their own `.traineddata` files. This is a critical security measure.
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Verify the integrity of `.traineddata` files (e.g., using checksums) before loading.
    *   **Secure Hosting:** Host `.traineddata` files yourself and serve them with strong security headers (CSP).

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Compromise of the `tesseract.js` package itself or its dependencies.
*   **tesseract.js Contribution:** The application is *directly* dependent on the security of `tesseract.js` and its dependencies.  A compromised package directly impacts the application.
*   **Example:** A malicious actor publishes a compromised version of `tesseract.js` or one of its dependencies to npm.
*   **Impact:** RCE, data breaches, complete application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Locking:** Use `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (yarn) to lock dependency versions. This is essential.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **SCA Tools:** Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify and manage dependency risks.
    *   **Version Pinning:** Pin dependencies to specific, known-good versions.
