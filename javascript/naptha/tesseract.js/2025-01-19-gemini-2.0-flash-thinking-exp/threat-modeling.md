# Threat Model Analysis for naptha/tesseract.js

## Threat: [Malicious Image Upload Exploitation](./threats/malicious_image_upload_exploitation.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Image Upload Exploitation
    * **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image. This image is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Tesseract.js's image processing logic (e.g., during decoding or analysis). The attacker aims to cause unexpected behavior or potentially execute arbitrary code within the user's browser.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service (browser crash or hang), unexpected application behavior, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) if the output is mishandled due to the exploit, or in severe cases, potentially exploiting browser vulnerabilities through flaws in Tesseract.js's processing.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `worker.js` (handles image processing tasks)
        * Image decoding modules within Tesseract.js (formats like PNG, JPEG, etc.)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Tesseract.js updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Implement robust server-side image validation *before* passing the image to the client-side Tesseract.js as a defense-in-depth measure.
        * Limit the size and dimensions of images allowed for processing.
        * Consider sandboxing the Tesseract.js execution environment if feasible (though browser sandboxing provides a degree of protection).
        * Implement error handling to gracefully manage unexpected issues during image processing.

## Threat: [WebAssembly (WASM) Module Vulnerabilities](./threats/webassembly__wasm__module_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** WebAssembly (WASM) Module Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Tesseract.js relies on a WebAssembly module (`tesseract-core.wasm`) for its core OCR functionality. An attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities within this WASM module if any exist. This could involve providing specific input that triggers a bug in the WASM code executed by Tesseract.js.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, unexpected behavior, potential for memory corruption within the WASM environment, or theoretically, sandbox escape if a critical vulnerability exists within the Tesseract.js WASM module and interacts with browser vulnerabilities.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `tesseract-core.wasm` (the core WebAssembly module)
        * Potentially the JavaScript interface interacting with the WASM module within Tesseract.js.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Tesseract.js updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for WASM vulnerabilities within the library.
        * Monitor security advisories related to Tesseract.js and its use of WebAssembly.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Tesseract.js or Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_tesseract_js_or_dependencies.md)

* **Threat:** Supply Chain Compromise of Tesseract.js or Dependencies
    * **Description:** The Tesseract.js library itself could be compromised by an attacker. This could involve malicious code being injected directly into the Tesseract.js library, which is then included in the application.
    * **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts directly stemming from the compromised Tesseract.js code, including data theft, injection of malicious scripts (leading to XSS within the application's context), or potentially more severe exploits depending on the nature of the compromise.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * The entire Tesseract.js library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use a package manager with security auditing features (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`).
        * Regularly update Tesseract.js to receive security patches.
        * Verify the integrity of downloaded Tesseract.js packages (e.g., using checksums).
        * Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
        * Be cautious about using unofficial or forked versions of Tesseract.js.
