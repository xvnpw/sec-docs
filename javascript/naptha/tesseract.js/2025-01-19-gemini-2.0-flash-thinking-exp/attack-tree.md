## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Goal:** To compromise the application by providing malicious input to the `tesseract.js` library.
    * **Attack Vector:** Supplying crafted images that exploit vulnerabilities in image processing.
    * **Critical Node: Supply Malicious Image:**
        * This is a critical point because the image data is the primary input to `tesseract.js`. Successfully providing a malicious image can directly lead to exploitation.
    * **High-Risk Path: Image designed to exploit vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries used by the browser or Tesseract.js:**
        * **Description:** Attackers craft images that leverage weaknesses in how the browser or `tesseract.js` decodes image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG). These vulnerabilities can lead to buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, or other memory corruption issues, potentially allowing for remote code execution or information disclosure.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the presence of unpatched vulnerabilities in browser or library dependencies).
        * **Impact:** High (potential for Remote Code Execution or sensitive information disclosure).
        * **Effort:** Medium (requires knowledge of image format vulnerabilities and crafting specific payloads).
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (may trigger errors or unexpected behavior, but sophisticated exploits might be harder to detect).
        * **Actionable Insight:** Ensure browser and `tesseract.js` dependencies are up-to-date. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential script injection if RCE is achieved. Server-side validation and sanitization of image data before client-side processing can also help.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Tesseract.js or its Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_tesseract_js_or_its_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Goal:** To compromise the application by exploiting known weaknesses within the `tesseract.js` library itself or its dependencies.
    * **Attack Vector:** Targeting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific version of `tesseract.js` being used.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific version of tesseract.js being used:**
        * This is critical because known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits, making them easier to target.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (if the application is not regularly updated).
        * **Impact:** Critical (can range from Remote Code Execution to Cross-Site Scripting, depending on the specific vulnerability).
        * **Effort:** Low (if exploits are publicly available) to High (if targeting a zero-day vulnerability).
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate (for using existing exploits) to Advanced (for discovering and exploiting zero-days).
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (security scanners can often detect known vulnerabilities).
        * **Actionable Insight:** Implement a robust process for regularly updating `tesseract.js` to the latest stable version. Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases to stay informed about potential threats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Goal:** To compromise the application by manipulating the text output generated by `tesseract.js`.
    * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious content into the OCR output that is then processed by the application.
    * **Critical Node: Manipulate OCR output to inject malicious content into the application's workflow:**
        * This is critical because the OCR output is often used directly by the application, making it a prime target for injection attacks.
        * **High-Risk Path: Inject script tags or other executable code into the output, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if not properly sanitized by the application:**
            * **Description:** Attackers craft images in a way that, when processed by `tesseract.js`, result in output containing malicious script tags (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`). If the application displays this output without proper sanitization, the script will execute in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium (common if OCR output is directly displayed or used in dynamic content generation without sanitization).
            * **Impact:** High (account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application).
            * **Effort:** Low (relatively easy to craft images that produce specific text output).
            * **Skill Level:** Novice.
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (can be detected by security scanners looking for unsanitized output or by observing suspicious behavior).
            * **Actionable Insight:**  Thoroughly sanitize and encode the OCR output before displaying it or using it in any application logic. Treat OCR output as untrusted user input. Use appropriate encoding functions for the context where the output is being used (e.g., HTML encoding for display in HTML).
