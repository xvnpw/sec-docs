# Attack Surface Analysis for naptha/tesseract.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Input](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_input.md)

*   **Description:** The application accepts image data as input for OCR processing. Maliciously crafted images can exploit vulnerabilities in the image decoding libraries used by the browser or within the `tesseract.js` library itself.
    *   **How tesseract.js Contributes:** `tesseract.js` is the component that processes the image data. If the underlying image decoding or processing logic within `tesseract.js` (or the browser's image handling) has vulnerabilities, a malicious image can trigger them.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG file that exploits a buffer overflow in the browser's PNG decoding library, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution within the browser's sandbox.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side denial of service (browser crash), potential for sandbox escape and arbitrary code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on the server-side before passing images to the client-side for processing.
        *   Limit the size and types of images accepted by the application.
        *   Ensure users are using up-to-date browsers with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider server-side OCR processing for sensitive applications to reduce client-side attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Underlying Tesseract Engine (Emscripten Port)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_underlying_tesseract_engine__emscripten_port_.md)

*   **Description:** `tesseract.js` is a port of the Tesseract OCR engine to JavaScript using Emscripten. Vulnerabilities present in the original C++ Tesseract engine might still be exploitable in the JavaScript port.
    *   **How tesseract.js Contributes:** By using `tesseract.js`, the application inherits any security vulnerabilities present in the underlying Tesseract engine that were not adequately mitigated during the porting process.
    *   **Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability in the Tesseract C++ code, if not properly handled by Emscripten or `tesseract.js`, could potentially be triggered by processing a specific type of image, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side denial of service, potential for sandbox escape and arbitrary code execution within the browser (depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the effectiveness of the browser's sandbox).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `tesseract.js` updated to the latest version, as updates often include security patches for underlying Tesseract vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor the security advisories for the upstream Tesseract project.
        *   Consider the security implications of using a ported library and the potential for vulnerabilities introduced during the porting process.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Attacks via Extracted Text](./attack_surfaces/injection_attacks_via_extracted_text.md)

*   **Description:** If the text extracted by `tesseract.js` is used in the application without proper sanitization or encoding, it can be a source of injection vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection if the output is sent to a backend).
    *   **How tesseract.js Contributes:** `tesseract.js` provides the raw, extracted text. If this text contains malicious code or characters, and the application doesn't handle it securely, it can lead to injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads an image containing text with embedded JavaScript. The `tesseract.js` extracts this script, and the application then renders this extracted text on a webpage without proper escaping, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection (if the output is used in backend queries), command injection (if the output is used in system commands).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict output encoding and sanitization:** Always sanitize or encode the text extracted by `tesseract.js` before displaying it on a webpage or using it in backend operations. Use context-aware escaping techniques.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when handling the extracted text.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
