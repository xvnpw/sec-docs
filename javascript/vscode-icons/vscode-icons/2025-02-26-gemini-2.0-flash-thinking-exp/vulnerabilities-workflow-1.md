### Combined Vulnerability List for vscode-icons Project

This list combines vulnerabilities identified across multiple reports, removing duplicates and presenting each vulnerability with detailed descriptions, impact assessments, mitigation strategies, and testing procedures.

#### 1. Malicious SVG Injection via Unsanitized Icon Files

**Description:**
An attacker can craft a specially malformed or “malicious” SVG file (for example, embedding unexpected scripts or event handlers) that, when served as a file‐icon by the extension, may trigger the execution of arbitrary code in the VSCode extension host. An attacker’s workflow might be to create or modify a project (or supply an icon update via a pull request) so that a malicious SVG is introduced. When an unsuspecting user opens a workspace that contains this SVG and the extension loads it as an icon, the unsanitized SVG could execute its embedded payload.

**Impact:**
If triggered, the malicious SVG payload may lead to remote code execution within the context of VSCode. This could allow an attacker to compromise the extension host environment, potentially exfiltrating data from the user’s workspace or installing further malware.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The repository’s asset management and build pipelines use SVG files directly for icons.
- Multiple changelog entries and conversion steps (e.g. from PNG to SVG in some workflows) indicate that SVG assets are maintained but no dedicated sanitization step is observed in the provided project files.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- There is no evidence that the extension’s code sanitizes SVG payloads before rendering (for example, by stripping out embedded JavaScript or disabling script execution).
- No Content Security Policy (CSP) or other runtime guard is in place to prevent potentially dangerous script execution when an SVG is rendered in a webview or comparable context.

**Preconditions:**
- A user must open a workspace (or trigger icon auto‑detection) containing the maliciously crafted SVG file.
- The malicious file must be loaded directly by the extension’s icon rendering logic without prior sanitation.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- A review of the CHANGELOG and associated build workflows (for example, the “svg-icon-check.yml” workflow) shows that SVG files are a critical asset for the extension.
- No instructions or code snippets are found in the public documentation or configuration files that indicate any form of SVG sanitization or strict CSP header enforcement in the extension’s runtime.
- The lack of source code for the actual extension activation and icon‐rendering routines in the provided files makes it difficult to confirm a sanitization step; however, the absence of documentation about such a safeguard implies that SVG files are rendered “as‑is.”

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Test Setup:**
   - In a controlled test environment, create a sample project (or fork an existing repository) with a custom file icon configuration that directs the extension to use an SVG file placed in a workspace folder.
2. **Malicious SVG Preparation:**
   - Modify the sample SVG file to include a hidden JavaScript payload. For example, insert a `<script>` element or an event attribute (such as `onload`) that triggers a visible change (e.g. prompt or log an alert).
3. **Execution:**
   - Install the extension in a test instance of VSCode and open the workspace containing the malicious SVG file.
   - Observe the file explorer or any webview where the icon is rendered.
4. **Verification:**
   - Monitor for any evidence of the injected JavaScript being executed (through a visible alert, log output, or network request).
   - If the payload is executed, then it confirms that no SVG sanitization is in place and that the vulnerability is reproducible.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Record the exact steps, screenshots or logs, and describe precisely how the malicious payload was delivered and executed.

#### 2. Unpinned GitHub Action Dependency in Publish Workflow

**Description:**
The repository’s publish workflow (defined in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`) uses the GitHub Action
`HaaLeo/publish-vscode-extension@v1` without pinning to a specific commit hash or version. In this configuration the workflow will automatically pull the latest code from the tagged “v1” release. If an attacker were able to compromise that action’s repository or if a dependency confusion attack were mounted, the published extension package could be modified to include arbitrary or malicious code.

**Impact:**
A compromised publish step could lead to the generation and distribution of a malicious VSIX package which, when installed by unsuspecting users, would run with the privileges of the extension host. This could result in code execution on the users’ systems, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the VSCode environment.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The workflow specifies the dependency using the “@v1” tag, and GitHub Actions automatically provides a secured run-time environment.
- The publish process appears to be gated by secret tokens (e.g. `VSCE_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`) which are only available in the trusted environment.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- There is no pinning of the action to an immutable commit SHA. This means that any changes (malicious or benign) pushed to the “v1” release branch of the action’s repository will immediately impact the publisher workflow.
- A specific commit hash should be used so that the code executing in the publish process is immutable and reviewable.

**Preconditions:**
- An attacker would need to compromise the upstream GitHub Action repository (or exploit the way GitHub Actions “@v1” resolution works) so that the published action contains malicious code.
- The publish workflow must be triggered by a push on a release tag.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In the publish.yml file the “Publish to Visual Studio Marketplace” step uses the following line:
  > `uses: HaaLeo/publish-vscode-extension@v1`

  No commit SHA is specified. The action will therefore always use the latest commit from the `v1` tag.
- Without an explicit hash pin, the extension trust boundary is expanded to include any code changes made in the publish action’s repository.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Test Setup:**
   - In a controlled test (e.g. on a fork or staging branch), modify the publish workflow temporarily to point to an alternative (controlled) version of the publish action—for example, one that echoes a distinctive marker in the logs.
2. **Controlled Simulation:**
   - Trigger a publish workflow (for instance, by pushing a valid version tag) and observe the log output.
   - Verify that the version of the publish action in use is not read-only and that changes to that action (if simulated) would be reflected in the workflow.
3. **Verification:**
   - Replace the unpinned dependency with a fixed commit hash and trigger the workflow again. Confirm that when using the pinned version the output remains constant even if the upstream “v1” tag were to change.
4. **Demonstration of Risk:**
   - Document how a malicious change in the publish action (simulated within the controlled environment) would result in altered behavior of the publish workflow, thereby confirming the risk of not pinning the dependency.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Capture logs and steps that clearly demonstrate that an unpinned dependency would allow unforeseen changes to be pulled into the publish process.

#### 3. Content Injection via External Images in README

**Description:**
1. The `README.md` file of the `vscode-icons` project embeds images directly from the project's GitHub repository using `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs.
2. An attacker who gains write access to the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository, specifically the `master` branch and the `images` folder, can replace these image files (e.g., `logo@3x.png`, `screenshot.gif`).
3. When users view the `vscode-icons` extension page on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace or the project's README.md on GitHub, their browsers will load these externally hosted images.
4. If the attacker replaces these images with malicious content (e.g., offensive images, misleading screenshots, or images crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in image rendering), this malicious content will be displayed to users viewing the extension's information.

**Impact:**
- **Reputation Damage:** Attackers could replace the project logo or screenshots with misleading or offensive content, damaging the reputation of the `vscode-icons` extension and potentially the developers.
- **Misinformation:** Attackers could replace screenshots or diagrams to display false information about the extension's functionality, potentially misleading users.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- None in the project files. The security relies solely on the security of the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository and GitHub's infrastructure.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) on VS Code Marketplace:** While not controllable by the extension developers directly, the VS Code Marketplace could implement a strict CSP to limit the loading of external resources and mitigate potential risks from content injection.
- **Image Scanning and Validation on VS Code Marketplace:** The VS Code Marketplace could implement automated image scanning and validation for extensions to detect and prevent the hosting of malicious or inappropriate image content.
- **Enhanced Repository Security:** Robust access control and security practices for the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository are crucial to prevent unauthorized write access that could lead to this vulnerability.

**Preconditions:**
- The attacker must gain write access to the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository, specifically to the `master` branch and the `images` folder.
- Users must view the `vscode-icons` extension page on the VS Code Marketplace or the GitHub repository's `README.md` file to load the potentially malicious images.

**Source Code Analysis:**
```markdown
File: /code/README.md

...
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/master/images/logo@3x.png" alt="logo" width="250">
...
![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/master/images/screenshot.gif)
...
```
- The `README.md` file directly embeds images using `<img>` tags with `src` attributes pointing to `raw.githubusercontent.com`.
- These URLs directly reference files in the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` repository's `master` branch and `images` folder.
- There is no code within the project to validate or sanitize the content of these images.
- The vulnerability arises from the direct inclusion of external, repository-hosted images in the project's documentation that is publicly displayed on platforms like the VS Code Marketplace and GitHub.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:** Create a fork of the public `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository.
2. **Malicious Image Creation:** Prepare a simple image file (e.g., `malicious_logo.png`) containing benign but noticeable content (like a red cross or a warning symbol) to easily verify its display.
3. **Image Replacement in Fork:** In your forked repository, navigate to the `images` folder. Replace the existing `logo@3x.png` file with your `malicious_logo.png` file. Keep the filename the same (`logo@3x.png`).
4. **Commit and Push Changes:** Commit the change with a message like "Replace logo with test image" and push it to the `master` branch of your forked repository.
5. **Modify README in Fork:** Edit the `README.md` file in your forked repository.  No modification is actually needed if you want to test on your fork's README, as it already points to the relative path within your fork. However, if you want to specifically test the raw.githubusercontent link, ensure the `<img>` tag for the logo points to: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-github-username>/vscode-icons/master/images/logo@3x.png` (replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username).
6. **Verify Image Display on Forked Repository README:** Open the `README.md` file of your forked repository on GitHub in a web browser. Observe if the logo displayed is now your `malicious_logo.png` (the red cross or warning symbol). If it is, this confirms that you can control the image content displayed from the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL linked in the README.
