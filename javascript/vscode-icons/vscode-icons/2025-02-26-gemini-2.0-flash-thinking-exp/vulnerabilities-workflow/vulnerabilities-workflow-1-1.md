## Vulnerability List for vscode-icons Project

Based on the provided files (`/code/CHANGELOG.md`, `/code/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `/code/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `/code/crowdin.yml`, `/code/.github/workflows/coverage.yml`, `/code/.github/workflows/svg-icon-check.yml`, `/code/.github/workflows/wpil.yml`, `/code/.github/workflows/publish.yml`, `/code/.github/workflows/test.yml`, `/code/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/OTHER.yml`, `/code/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`, `/code/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ICON-REQUEST.yml`), no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were identified that meet the specified criteria for inclusion in this list.

**Reasoning:**

- The provided files consist of documentation, configuration files, and GitHub Actions workflow definitions. These files are related to project management, contribution guidelines, CI/CD processes, and issue reporting.
- They **do not contain the core source code** of the vscode-icons extension that directly handles icon theming or user interactions within VS Code.
- Therefore, these files are unlikely to contain vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker against a running instance of the vscode-icons extension in VS Code.
- Specifically, the workflows define automated processes within the GitHub environment and are not directly accessible or triggerable by external users against the installed VS Code extension. While there could be theoretical supply chain risks within the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., in `svg-icon-check.yml` if external tools or services were compromised), these are not vulnerabilities in the *vscode-icons extension itself* as experienced by a user and are not triggered by direct interaction with a publicly available instance of the extension.
- The files do not exhibit insecure code patterns caused by developers explicitly using project files in an insecure way, lack documentation for mitigation of vulnerabilities, or represent denial of service vulnerabilities in the context of a publicly available VS Code extension instance.

**Conclusion:**

After analyzing the provided project files, no vulnerabilities meeting the criteria for inclusion (valid, unmitigated, rank high or critical, and exploitable by an external attacker against a publicly available instance, excluding those explicitly excluded) were found. To assess the security of the vscode-icons extension itself, analysis of the core extension's source code would be required, which is not present in the provided files.
