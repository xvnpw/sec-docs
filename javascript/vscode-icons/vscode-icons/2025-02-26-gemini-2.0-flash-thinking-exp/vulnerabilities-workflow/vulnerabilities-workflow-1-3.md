### Vulnerability List for vscode-icons Project

* Vulnerability Name: Content Injection via External Images in README

* Description:
    1. The `README.md` file of the `vscode-icons` project embeds images directly from the project's GitHub repository using `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs.
    2. An attacker who gains write access to the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository, specifically the `master` branch and the `images` folder, can replace these image files (e.g., `logo@3x.png`, `screenshot.gif`).
    3. When users view the `vscode-icons` extension page on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace or the project's README.md on GitHub, their browsers will load these externally hosted images.
    4. If the attacker replaces these images with malicious content (e.g., offensive images, misleading screenshots, or images crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in image rendering), this malicious content will be displayed to users viewing the extension's information.

* Impact:
    - **Reputation Damage:** Attackers could replace the project logo or screenshots with misleading or offensive content, damaging the reputation of the `vscode-icons` extension and potentially the developers.
    - **Misinformation:** Attackers could replace screenshots or diagrams to display false information about the extension's functionality, potentially misleading users.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the project files. The security relies solely on the security of the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository and GitHub's infrastructure.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) on VS Code Marketplace:** While not controllable by the extension developers directly, the VS Code Marketplace could implement a strict CSP to limit the loading of external resources and mitigate potential risks from content injection.
    - **Image Scanning and Validation on VS Code Marketplace:** The VS Code Marketplace could implement automated image scanning and validation for extensions to detect and prevent the hosting of malicious or inappropriate image content.
    - **Enhanced Repository Security:** Robust access control and security practices for the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository are crucial to prevent unauthorized write access that could lead to this vulnerability.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must gain write access to the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository, specifically to the `master` branch and the `images` folder.
    - Users must view the `vscode-icons` extension page on the VS Code Marketplace or the GitHub repository's `README.md` file to load the potentially malicious images.

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```markdown
    File: /code/README.md

    ...
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/master/images/logo@3x.png" alt="logo" width="250">
    ...
    ![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/master/images/screenshot.gif)
    ...
    ```
    - The `README.md` file directly embeds images using `<img>` tags with `src` attributes pointing to `raw.githubusercontent.com`.
    - These URLs directly reference files in the `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` repository's `master` branch and `images` folder.
    - There is no code within the project to validate or sanitize the content of these images.
    - The vulnerability arises from the direct inclusion of external, repository-hosted images in the project's documentation that is publicly displayed on platforms like the VS Code Marketplace and GitHub.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Create a fork of the public `vscode-icons/vscode-icons` GitHub repository.
    2. **Malicious Image Creation:** Prepare a simple image file (e.g., `malicious_logo.png`) containing benign but noticeable content (like a red cross or a warning symbol) to easily verify its display.
    3. **Image Replacement in Fork:** In your forked repository, navigate to the `images` folder. Replace the existing `logo@3x.png` file with your `malicious_logo.png` file. Keep the filename the same (`logo@3x.png`).
    4. **Commit and Push Changes:** Commit the change with a message like "Replace logo with test image" and push it to the `master` branch of your forked repository.
    5. **Modify README in Fork:** Edit the `README.md` file in your forked repository.  No modification is actually needed if you want to test on your fork's README, as it already points to the relative path within your fork. However, if you want to specifically test the raw.githubusercontent link, ensure the `<img>` tag for the logo points to: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-github-username>/vscode-icons/master/images/logo@3x.png` (replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username).
    6. **Verify Image Display on Forked Repository README:** Open the `README.md` file of your forked repository on GitHub in a web browser. Observe if the logo displayed is now your `malicious_logo.png` (the red cross or warning symbol). If it is, this confirms that you can control the image content displayed from the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL linked in the README.
