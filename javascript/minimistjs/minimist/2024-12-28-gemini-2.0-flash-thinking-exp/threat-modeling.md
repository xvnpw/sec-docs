Here's an updated list of high and critical threats directly involving the `minimist` library:

*   **Threat:** Argument Injection / Command Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious command-line arguments. The application, without proper sanitization, uses these argument values *directly parsed by `minimist`* in system calls or other sensitive operations. The attacker can inject arbitrary commands that the system will execute.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data loss, complete system compromise, unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific command-line arguments that exploit *how `minimist` handles object property assignment*. This allows the attacker to modify the `Object.prototype`, potentially affecting the behavior of the entire application and its dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, security bypasses, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution depending on how the polluted prototype is used by the application or its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Argument Values
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides argument values *parsed by `minimist`* that are used to construct file paths without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to access files outside the intended directory, potentially gaining access to sensitive system files or application data.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, and in some cases, the ability to execute arbitrary code if accessed files are executable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
