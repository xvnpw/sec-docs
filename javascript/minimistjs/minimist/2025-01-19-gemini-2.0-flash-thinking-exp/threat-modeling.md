# Threat Model Analysis for minimistjs/minimist

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution](./threats/prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution
    *   **Description:** An attacker can craft command-line arguments that, when parsed by `minimist`, directly modify the `Object.prototype`. This is achieved by using arguments like `--__proto__.polluted=true` or `--constructor.prototype.polluted=true`. `minimist`'s parsing logic processes these arguments and assigns the provided values to the corresponding prototype properties.
    *   **Impact:** Modifying `Object.prototype` can lead to a wide range of critical issues:
        *   **Denial of Service:** By setting properties that cause errors or unexpected behavior in core JavaScript functions or application logic, leading to crashes or hangs.
        *   **Security Bypass:** By manipulating properties used in authentication or authorization checks, potentially granting unauthorized access.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (in some scenarios):** If the application or its dependencies rely on properties of `Object.prototype` in a way that can be exploited by an attacker controlling those properties, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** `minimist`'s core parsing logic, specifically the mechanism for handling property assignment based on provided arguments, including those targeting `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid direct use of user-controlled input for object property assignment:** Do not directly use the output of `minimist` to set properties on objects without careful validation and sanitization, especially when the keys are derived from user input.
        *   **Freeze prototypes:** Use `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)` and `Object.freeze(Function.prototype)` to prevent modifications. Be aware of potential compatibility issues with this approach.
        *   **Use `Object.create(null)` for objects where prototype inheritance is not needed:** This creates objects without the standard `Object.prototype`, preventing pollution through that avenue when dealing with parsed arguments.
        *   **Consider alternative argument parsing libraries:** If prototype pollution is a significant and unavoidable concern with the current usage, explore libraries with built-in protections against this vulnerability.
