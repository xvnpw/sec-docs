## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Argument Injection/Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_argument_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   This path represents the general strategy of manipulating command-line arguments parsed by `minimist` to compromise the application. It encompasses several specific techniques.

    *   **Critical Node: Application Logic Vulnerability (under Type Confusion)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects arguments that cause `minimist` to misinterpret the data type (e.g., a string as a number, or vice-versa). The application then uses this misinterpreted value in a security-sensitive operation without proper validation.
        *   **Example:** Injecting `--port=malicious_string` when the application expects a number for the port, and then uses this string in a network connection attempt, potentially leading to an error or connection to an unintended destination.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Prototype Pollution](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_prototype_pollution.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting a specific JavaScript vulnerability.

        *   **Critical Node: Inject Argument to Modify Object.prototype**
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a command-line argument specifically designed to modify the `Object.prototype`. This is typically done using arguments like `--__proto__.polluted=true` or similar variations targeting the prototype chain.
            *   **Impact:** Successfully modifying `Object.prototype` can have widespread consequences, affecting all objects in the application.

        *   **Critical Node: Application Logic Vulnerability (under Prototype Pollution)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** After successfully polluting the `Object.prototype`, the attacker relies on the application's logic to access or use the modified properties. If the application checks for the existence or value of a property on an object without explicitly owning that property (i.e., it's inherited from the prototype), the attacker-controlled value will be used.
            *   **Example:** The application checks if `obj.isAdmin` is true. If the attacker has set `Object.prototype.isAdmin = true`, this check will incorrectly pass, potentially granting unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Double-Dash (`--`) Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_double-dash___--___behavior.md)

*   This path exploits how `minimist` handles arguments after the double-dash (`--`).

        *   **Critical Node: Inject Arguments After Double-Dash Intended as Data**
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects command-line arguments after the `--` separator. `minimist` treats these as positional arguments and makes them available in the `_` property. If the application then passes these arguments to an external command without proper sanitization, it can lead to command injection.
            *   **Example:**  The application executes a command like `shell.exec('ls ' + args._.join(' '))`. An attacker could provide arguments like `-- ; rm -rf /`, which would be passed to the `ls` command, resulting in the execution of `rm -rf /`.

        *   **Critical Node: Application Logic Vulnerability (under Double-Dash)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The application takes the arguments provided after the `--` and passes them to an external process without proper sanitization or validation. This allows the attacker to inject malicious commands that will be executed by the system.
            *   **Impact:** Successful command injection can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
