# Attack Surface Analysis for minimistjs/minimist

## Attack Surface: [Argument Injection](./attack_surfaces/argument_injection.md)

*   **How `minimist` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `minimist` parses command-line arguments provided as strings, directly translating them into an object that the application uses. This makes the application susceptible to malicious arguments if not handled carefully.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides the argument `--config /etc/passwd` when the application uses the `config` argument to load configuration files without proper validation.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially leads to unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification of application behavior, or even remote code execution depending on how the injected argument is used by the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate all parsed arguments against an expected format or a whitelist of allowed values.
        *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize argument values to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before using them in sensitive operations.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the application so that even with malicious arguments, the damage is limited due to restricted permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Flag Overwriting/Confusion via Aliases](./attack_surfaces/flag_overwritingconfusion_via_aliases.md)

*   **How `minimist` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `minimist`'s functionality of allowing aliases for arguments can be exploited. An attacker can provide both the original flag and its alias with conflicting values, leading to unexpected application state due to `minimist`'s parsing.
    *   **Example:** If `--verbose` is aliased to `-v`, an attacker provides both `--verbose false -v true`. The application might incorrectly interpret the verbosity level depending on the parsing order and how it accesses the argument provided by `minimist`.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to incorrect application behavior, bypassing security checks, or exposing more information than intended.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Alias Design:**  Thoroughly consider the implications of aliases and avoid creating aliases that could lead to confusion or conflicting interpretations.
        *   **Consistent Access:** Access argument values consistently (either always by the original flag or always by the alias) to avoid ambiguity in how the application interprets `minimist`'s output.
        *   **Explicit Checks:** If both the original flag and its alias are used, implement explicit checks to handle potential conflicts arising from `minimist`'s parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Argument Value Injection leading to Indirect Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/argument_value_injection_leading_to_indirect_code_execution.md)

*   **How `minimist` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `minimist` provides the raw, parsed string values of arguments. If the application uses these values in a way that involves further processing or execution (e.g., as part of a command-line call or file path), attackers can inject malicious commands or paths through the arguments parsed by `minimist`.
    *   **Example:** An argument `--file` is used to specify a file path, and an attacker provides `--file "; rm -rf /"`. If the application naively uses this value (obtained from `minimist`) in a shell command, it could lead to arbitrary command execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or client, data breaches, or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Execution with User Input:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of parsed argument values (from `minimist`) in dynamic code execution contexts (e.g., `eval`, `Function`, shell commands).
        *   **Secure Command Execution:** If executing external commands is necessary, use libraries that provide safe command execution with proper escaping and parameterization of the values obtained from `minimist`.
        *   **Path Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize file paths obtained from `minimist` to prevent directory traversal or command injection.
