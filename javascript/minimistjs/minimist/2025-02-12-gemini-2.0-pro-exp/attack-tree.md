[HIGH RISK]: The left branch (Prototype Pollution) is marked as [HIGH RISK].
[HIGH RISK]: The middle branch (DoS via Excessive Object Creation) is also marked as [HIGH RISK].

## Attack Tree Path: [Prototype Pollution via `__proto__` Alias (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/prototype_pollution_via____proto____alias__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This attack exploits a vulnerability (often in older versions of `minimist` or through misconfiguration) where an attacker can inject properties onto the `Object.prototype` in JavaScript. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the application later uses the polluted object in an unsafe way.

*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Application Misconfigures `minimist`:** This is the fundamental flaw. The application must be set up in a way that allows user-provided input to influence the object parsing process of `minimist` without proper sanitization.
    *   **No Input Validation on User-Provided Arguments:** This is the *specific* misconfiguration. The application does not check or filter the command-line arguments before passing them to `minimist`. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary arguments, including those that target the `__proto__` property.

*   **High-Risk Path Steps:**
    1.  **Vulnerable `minimist` Version:** While less likely with updated versions, using an older, unpatched version of `minimist` increases the risk.
    2.  **Application Misconfigures `minimist` [CRITICAL]:** The application lacks crucial security measures, primarily input validation.
    3.  **No Input Validation on User-Provided Arguments [CRITICAL]:** The application blindly trusts user-supplied command-line arguments.
    4.  **Attacker Provides `--__proto__.<evil_key>=<evil_value>` as CLI Arg:** The attacker crafts a malicious command-line argument to inject a property onto `Object.prototype`.
    5.  **Application Logic Uses Polluted Object:** The application's code accesses the polluted object, triggering the attacker's injected code.
    6.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker gains control of the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

* **Example:**
    *   Attacker runs the application with: `node app.js --__proto__.toString=()=>console.log('pwned!')`
    *   If the application later calls `.toString()` on any object (which is very common), the attacker's code will execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [DoS via Excessive Object Creation (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/dos_via_excessive_object_creation__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This attack leverages the way `minimist` parses nested objects from command-line arguments. By providing a deeply nested object structure, an attacker can cause the application to consume excessive memory, leading to a denial-of-service.

*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Application Misconfigures `minimist`:** The application must be configured to allow user input to create potentially large or deeply nested objects.
    *   **No Input Validation on User-Provided Arguments:** The application does not limit the depth or size of objects that can be created via command-line arguments.

*   **High-Risk Path Steps:**
    1.  **Vulnerable `minimist` Version:** While not a direct vulnerability, `minimist`'s parsing can be abused.
    2.  **Application Misconfigures `minimist` [CRITICAL]:** The application lacks input validation and limits on object size/depth.
    3.  **No Input Validation on User-Provided Arguments [CRITICAL]:** The application doesn't restrict the structure of user-provided arguments.
    4.  **Attacker Provides Deeply Nested Object as CLI Arg:** The attacker crafts a command-line argument to create a very large or deeply nested object.
    5.  **Denial of Service:** The application runs out of memory or becomes unresponsive.

* **Example:**
    *   Attacker runs the application with: `node app.js --a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.l.m.n.o.p=value --x.y.z.aa.bb.cc.dd.ee.ff.gg.hh.ii.jj.kk.ll.mm=value` (repeated many times, or with very long key names).
    *   This can cause the application to allocate a large amount of memory, leading to a crash or unresponsiveness.
