# Attack Surface Analysis for minimistjs/minimist

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution.md)

  
*   **Description:**  Injection of properties into the global `Object.prototype`, leading to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution.
*   **How Minimist Contributes:**  Older versions of `minimist` (before 1.2.6) were vulnerable to prototype pollution through specially crafted command-line arguments using properties like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`.  `minimist`'s parsing logic did not prevent these properties from being assigned, *directly* enabling the attack.
*   **Example:**
    ```bash
    node vulnerable-app.js --__proto__.polluted=true
    node vulnerable-app.js --a.__proto__.polluted=true
    node vulnerable-app.js --constructor.prototype.polluted=true

    ```
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application crashes or becomes unresponsive.
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Attacker executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   Data Tampering: Modification of application data or behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (in vulnerable versions)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Update Minimist (Essential):** Use `minimist` version 1.2.6 or later. This is the primary and most effective mitigation, directly addressing the vulnerability within `minimist`.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**  Validate and sanitize all command-line arguments.  Whitelist allowed arguments and their expected types.  Reject any input that doesn't conform to the whitelist. While this is a good practice, it's secondary to updating `minimist`.
    *   **Avoid Dangerous Properties:** Do not directly access or rely on properties like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` in application logic. This is a general good practice, but updating `minimist` is the core mitigation.
    *   **Code Review:** Regularly review code for potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities. Again, this is a good practice but secondary to the direct fix of updating.
