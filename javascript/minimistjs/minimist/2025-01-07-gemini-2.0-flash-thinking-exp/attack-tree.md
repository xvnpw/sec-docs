## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via `minimist`](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via__minimist_.md)

*   **Compromise Application via `minimist`:**
    *   This is the attacker's ultimate objective. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security posture through exploitation of the `minimist` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in `minimist`](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in__minimist_.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerability in `minimist`:**
    *   This node represents the initial step where the attacker identifies and leverages a weakness within the `minimist` library itself. This could be a known vulnerability like prototype pollution or a flaw in how `minimist` processes arguments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Prototype Pollution](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Achieve Prototype Pollution:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** By providing command-line arguments with keys like `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`, an attacker can modify the properties of the base JavaScript `Object` prototype. This can have widespread and unpredictable effects on the application's behavior, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or security bypasses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Argument Injection/Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_argument_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Achieve Argument Injection/Manipulation:**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Introducing Unexpected Arguments:** Supplying command-line arguments that the application's logic doesn't anticipate or handle correctly, leading to unintended code execution or side effects.
        *   **Overwriting Existing Arguments:** Providing arguments that redefine the meaning or value of arguments the application expects, potentially altering critical configurations or bypassing security checks.
        *   **Bypassing Security Checks:** Injecting arguments specifically crafted to circumvent input validation or sanitization routines implemented by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Exploited Vulnerability for Malicious Actions](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_exploited_vulnerability_for_malicious_actions.md)

*   **Leverage Exploited Vulnerability for Malicious Actions:**
    *   This node represents the stage where the attacker, having successfully exploited a vulnerability in `minimist`, now uses that foothold to achieve their specific malicious goals within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Prototype Pollution](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Achieve Prototype Pollution:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** As described above, manipulating the `Object` prototype through specially crafted command-line arguments.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Can lead to arbitrary code execution, security bypasses, and widespread application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Existing Arguments](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_existing_arguments.md)

*   **Overwrite Existing Arguments:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Supplying command-line arguments that have the same names as arguments the application expects but with malicious or unexpected values.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Can alter application behavior, bypass security checks, or modify critical configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Checks](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_checks.md)

*   **Bypass Security Checks:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting command-line arguments that specifically evade the application's input validation or sanitization mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** High - Allows attackers to inject malicious data or commands that would otherwise be blocked.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Cause Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Exhaust Resources:** Providing an extremely large number of arguments or arguments that create deeply nested objects, consuming excessive memory or processing power and causing the application to slow down or crash.
        *   **Trigger Unhandled Exception:** Supplying malformed or unexpected argument structures that the application's parsing logic cannot handle gracefully, leading to unhandled exceptions and crashes.
    *   **Impact:** Medium - Disrupts application availability and prevents legitimate users from accessing it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code.md)

*   **Execute Arbitrary Code:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging vulnerabilities like prototype pollution or successful argument injection to inject and execute malicious code within the application's environment. This could involve modifying application logic, executing system commands, or installing backdoors.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Grants the attacker complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Data Breach](./attack_tree_paths/cause_data_breach.md)

*   **Cause Data Breach:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to manipulate the application's behavior in a way that allows access to or exfiltration of sensitive data. This could involve bypassing authorization checks or altering data retrieval processes.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Results in the loss of confidential information, potentially leading to legal and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Application Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_application_functionality.md)

*   **Disrupt Application Functionality:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Utilizing vulnerabilities to cause errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior in the application, making it unusable or unreliable for legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Degrades the user experience and can disrupt critical business processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Privilege Escalation (Context Dependent)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_privilege_escalation__context_dependent_.md)

*   **Achieve Privilege Escalation (Context Dependent):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** In scenarios where the application runs with elevated privileges, exploiting `minimist` vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain higher permissions on the system, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Grants the attacker significant control over the system, potentially allowing them to perform any action.
