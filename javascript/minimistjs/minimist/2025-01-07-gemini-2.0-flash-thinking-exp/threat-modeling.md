# Threat Model Analysis for minimistjs/minimist

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution](./threats/prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts command-line arguments containing specially formatted keys (e.g., `__proto__.polluted`) that, when parsed by `minimist`, inject properties into the `Object.prototype`. This allows the attacker to modify the behavior of all JavaScript objects in the application's runtime.
    *   **Impact:**  Code injection (by overwriting built-in functions or prototype methods), privilege escalation (if injected properties bypass security checks), denial of service (by modifying properties that cause crashes or infinite loops), information disclosure (if injected properties expose sensitive data), and general unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Affected `minimist` Component:** The core parsing logic within the main `minimist` module, specifically the part responsible for assigning values to the resulting object based on the parsed arguments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Upgrade to the latest version of `minimist` that includes mitigations against prototype pollution.
        *   Sanitize or validate the keys of the parsed arguments before using them to access or set object properties.
        *   Avoid directly using the parsed arguments to set object properties without strict validation. Consider alternative approaches like mapping allowed arguments to specific configuration options.
        *   Employ security analysis tools to detect potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Argument Injection/Abuse](./threats/argument_injectionabuse.md)

*   **Threat:** Argument Injection/Abuse
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides unexpected or malicious command-line arguments that, when processed by `minimist`, can alter the application's intended behavior *due to how `minimist` parses and interprets those arguments*. This could involve providing arguments that, due to `minimist`'s parsing logic, lead to unintended data structures or values being produced.
    *   **Impact:**  Configuration manipulation leading to security vulnerabilities (e.g., if `minimist` misinterprets an argument intended for a security setting), denial of service (by providing arguments that cause `minimist` to produce data structures that lead to resource exhaustion in later application logic), information disclosure (if `minimist`'s parsing leads to the exposure of internal data through the resulting argument object), and unexpected application functionality.
    *   **Affected `minimist` Component:** The core parsing logic within the main `minimist` module, specifically how it interprets and assigns values to arguments based on the provided input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define and strictly enforce the set of expected command-line arguments. Ignore or reject any unexpected arguments.
        *   Validate the format and values of all parsed arguments *produced by `minimist`* before using them in the application logic. Implement whitelisting of allowed values.
        *   Thoroughly test how `minimist` handles various input combinations to identify potential unexpected parsing behaviors.
