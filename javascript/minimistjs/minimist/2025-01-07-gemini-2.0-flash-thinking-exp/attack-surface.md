# Attack Surface Analysis for minimistjs/minimist

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes in JavaScript. This can globally affect the behavior of the application and potentially other libraries.
    *   **How `minimist` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `minimist` parses command-line arguments and creates a plain JavaScript object to store them. It allows arguments with names like `__proto__.polluted` or `constructor.prototype.polluted`, which directly modify the prototypes.
    *   **Example:**  Running the application with the argument `--__proto__.isAdmin=true` could add an `isAdmin` property with the value `true` to `Object.prototype`, affecting all objects in the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to unexpected application behavior, security bypasses (e.g., gaining administrative privileges if the application checks `obj.isAdmin`), or denial of service by modifying critical object properties.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `minimist` or use a version with mitigations for prototype pollution (if available).
        *   Sanitize or disallow argument names that could lead to prototype pollution (e.g., those containing `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`).
        *   Use object factories or `Object.create(null)` to create objects that don't inherit from `Object.prototype` for storing parsed arguments.
        *   Freeze the prototype of objects used to store parsed arguments if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Argument Values](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsanitized_argument_values.md)

*   **Description:** If argument values parsed by `minimist` are directly used in shell commands or system calls without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands.
    *   **How `minimist` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `minimist` parses the command-line arguments and provides the values as strings. It doesn't perform any inherent sanitization or validation on these values.
    *   **Example:** If the application uses `child_process.exec(command + ' ' + options.file)`, and an attacker provides `--file="; rm -rf /"`, the executed command becomes vulnerable to command injection.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or client machine running the application, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly execute shell commands with user-provided input.**
        *   If shell execution is necessary, use parameterized commands or libraries that offer built-in sanitization (e.g., libraries that escape arguments for specific shells).
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all argument values obtained from `minimist` before using them in any system calls or external commands.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege when executing external commands.
