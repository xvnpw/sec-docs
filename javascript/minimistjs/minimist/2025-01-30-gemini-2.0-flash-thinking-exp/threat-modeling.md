# Threat Model Analysis for minimistjs/minimist

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution](./threats/prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution
*   **Description:**  Due to its parsing logic, `minimist` is vulnerable to prototype pollution. An attacker can craft specific command-line arguments designed to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` or other built-in JavaScript prototypes *during the argument parsing process itself*. This occurs because of how `minimist` handles argument names and assigns values, allowing manipulation of prototype chain properties like `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application logic bypass: Altered prototype behavior can lead to unexpected application flow and security bypasses within the application using `minimist`.
    *   Indirect Remote Code Execution: Prototype pollution can be a prerequisite or component in a chain of vulnerabilities leading to remote code execution in certain application contexts.
    *   Data corruption: Modified prototypes can cause unexpected data modifications and application instability within the JavaScript environment where `minimist` is used.
*   **Minimist Component Affected:** Core argument parsing logic within the `minimist` module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on application context and reliance on prototypes)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Upgrade Minimist or Migrate:  The most effective mitigation is to upgrade to the latest version of `minimist` if patches are available, or, preferably, migrate to a more secure and actively maintained argument parsing library that is not known to be vulnerable to prototype pollution.
    *   Input Sanitization and Validation (Post-Parsing): While not directly mitigating the prototype pollution vulnerability in `minimist` itself, validating and sanitizing parsed arguments *after* `minimist` processing can help reduce the *impact* of potential prototype pollution by ensuring that downstream application logic is robust and does not rely on potentially polluted prototypes in unsafe ways. However, this is a secondary defense and does not address the root vulnerability in `minimist`.
    *   Object Freezing (Defensive Measure): As a defensive measure, consider freezing critical objects and prototypes in your application to prevent *modification* after parsing. This can limit the exploitability of prototype pollution, but might have compatibility implications and is not a direct fix for the `minimist` vulnerability.
    *   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits specifically looking for potential consequences of prototype pollution in your application's logic and dependencies, given that you are using `minimist`. Consider static analysis tools that can detect prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
