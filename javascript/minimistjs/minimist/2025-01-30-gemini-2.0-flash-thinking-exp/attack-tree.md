## Attack Tree Path: [Prototype Pollution via Argument Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/prototype_pollution_via_argument_parsing.md)

**Attack Vector Description:** This path exploits a vulnerability where `minimist`'s parsing logic, when handling specific argument structures, can allow an attacker to modify the prototypes of JavaScript objects. This can lead to application-wide consequences.

*   **Critical Node: Craft Arguments to Overwrite Prototype Properties (__proto__, constructor.prototype)**
    *   **Attack Step:** The attacker crafts command-line arguments specifically designed to target and overwrite properties of the `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` of JavaScript objects.
    *   **Example Arguments:** `--__proto__.polluted=true`, `--constructor.prototype.isAdmin=false`
    *   **Impact:** Successful prototype pollution can modify the behavior of all objects inheriting from the polluted prototype. This can lead to:
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting properties that cause errors or infinite loops when accessed.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If polluted properties are used in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., access control checks, code execution paths).
        *   **Information Disclosure:** By modifying properties that control data access or visibility.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Upgrade `minimist` to the latest version.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization of argument names and values.
        *   Consider using alternative argument parsing libraries that are designed to prevent prototype pollution.
        *   Perform code reviews and static analysis to identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Argument Injection & Command Injection (Indirect via Application)](./attack_tree_paths/argument_injection_&_command_injection__indirect_via_application_.md)

**Attack Vector Description:** This path is not a direct vulnerability in `minimist` itself, but rather arises from how the application *uses* the arguments parsed by `minimist`. If the application uses these parsed arguments in unsafe operations (like executing shell commands, accessing files, or constructing database queries) without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks.

*   **Critical Node: Identify Application Code Using Parsed Arguments in Unsafe Operations**
    *   **Attack Step:** The attacker analyzes the application's code to find locations where arguments parsed by `minimist` are used in potentially unsafe operations.
    *   **Examples of Unsafe Operations:**
        *   Executing shell commands using `child_process.exec` or similar functions with parsed arguments.
        *   Constructing file paths using parsed arguments without proper validation (leading to path traversal).
        *   Building database queries using parsed arguments without parameterization (leading to SQL injection).

*   **Critical Node: Craft Argument Values to Inject Malicious Payloads**
    *   **Attack Step:** Once unsafe code locations are identified, the attacker crafts malicious argument values that, when processed by the application in those unsafe operations, will execute attacker-controlled commands or actions.
    *   **Example Argument for Command Injection:** `--file="; rm -rf / ;"` (if the application uses `args.file` in a shell command).
    *   **Impact:** Successful argument injection can lead to:
        *   **Command Injection:** Execution of arbitrary commands on the server.
        *   **File System Access:** Unauthorized reading, writing, or deletion of files.
        *   **Data Manipulation/Breach:** Accessing or modifying sensitive data in databases or files.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In many command injection scenarios, RCE is achievable.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* parsed argument values before using them in any sensitive operations.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run application processes with minimal necessary privileges.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:** Use parameterized functions or safer APIs instead of dynamically building shell commands with user input.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation Post-minimist Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation_post-minimist_parsing.md)

**Attack Vector Description:** This is the most common and often most critical vulnerability. Even if `minimist` parses arguments correctly, the application *must* validate and sanitize the parsed arguments *before* using them in any application logic. Failure to do so is a major security flaw.

*   **Critical Node: Application Fails to Validate Parsed Arguments**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The application code directly uses the output of `minimist` (the `args` object) without implementing any checks to ensure the validity, type, or safety of the parsed arguments.
    *   **Common Scenario:**  Developers assume that because `minimist` parsed the arguments, they are inherently safe or valid for the application's purposes, which is a dangerous assumption.

*   **Critical Node: Identify Application Code that Directly Uses minimist Output**
    *   **Attack Step:** The attacker identifies code sections where the `args` object (the result of `minimist` parsing) is directly accessed and used without prior validation.
    *   **Example Code Pattern:** `const filename = args.file;  fs.readFileSync(filename);` (without any validation on `filename`).

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Validation on Parsed Arguments**
    *   **Attack Step:** The attacker crafts malicious argument values that exploit the lack of validation in the identified code locations.
    *   **Example Argument for Path Traversal:** `--file="../etc/passwd"` (if the application uses `args.file` to access files without path validation).
    *   **Impact:** Exploiting the lack of input validation can lead to a wide range of vulnerabilities, including:
        *   **File System Access Vulnerabilities (Path Traversal):** Accessing files outside of the intended application directory.
        *   **Command Injection (as described in Path 2):** If unvalidated arguments are used in shell commands.
        *   **Data Manipulation/Breach:** If unvalidated arguments are used to access or modify data.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If unvalidated arguments are used to generate web page content.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Mandatory Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation for *every* parsed argument before using it in any application logic.
        *   **Use Validation Libraries:** Utilize input validation libraries to simplify and standardize validation processes.
        *   **Security Training for Developers:** Educate developers about the critical importance of input validation and secure coding practices.
