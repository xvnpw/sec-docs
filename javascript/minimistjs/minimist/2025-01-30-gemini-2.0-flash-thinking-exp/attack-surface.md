# Attack Surface Analysis for minimistjs/minimist

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution.md)

**Description:**  An attacker can manipulate the prototype of JavaScript objects by injecting properties into the `__proto__` object via command-line arguments. This can lead to unexpected application behavior, security bypasses, or even remote code execution.
*   **How minimist Contributes:** `minimist`'s parsing logic, specifically its handling of double underscores (`__proto__`) in command-line arguments, allows these arguments to directly modify the prototype chain. This is a direct vulnerability stemming from `minimist`'s design.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker provides the command-line argument: `--__proto__.isAdmin=true`
    *   If the application later checks `Object.prototype.isAdmin` or any object's `isAdmin` property inherited from the prototype, it will incorrectly evaluate to `true`, potentially bypassing authentication or authorization checks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Security Bypass
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) (in certain scenarios)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on application usage and exploitability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Upgrade `minimist`:** Check for and apply updates to `minimist` as vulnerabilities are patched in newer versions. While direct fixes in `minimist` for prototype pollution might be limited due to design choices, staying updated is generally good practice.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all command-line arguments *after* parsing by `minimist`.  Crucially, avoid using parsed arguments as keys to set object properties, especially when dealing with user input. Treat `minimist` output as untrusted.
    *   **Avoid Prototype Manipulation:**  Refrain from using user-controlled input to directly set properties on objects, particularly using bracket notation or accessing `__proto__`. Use safer object manipulation techniques that do not involve directly setting properties based on user-provided keys.
    *   **Object Freezing:**  If feasible, freeze critical objects or prototypes to prevent modification.

## Attack Surface: [Unexpected Argument Parsing Behavior (Leading to Logic Flaws & Input Validation Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/unexpected_argument_parsing_behavior__leading_to_logic_flaws_&_input_validation_bypass_.md)

**Description:**  `minimist`'s argument parsing might behave in ways that are not immediately obvious or expected by developers. This can lead to logic flaws and vulnerabilities if developers make incorrect assumptions about how arguments are processed, especially concerning input validation.
*   **How minimist Contributes:**  `minimist`'s specific rules for handling boolean flags, string/number coercion, array arguments, and special characters can lead to unexpected parsing outcomes if not fully understood and accounted for in application logic. This unexpected behavior is a direct consequence of `minimist`'s parsing implementation.
*   **Example:**
    *   Application expects `--id` to *always* be an integer. If an attacker provides `--id "NaN"`, `minimist` might parse it as a string `"NaN"`. If the application's input validation relies on `minimist` implicitly converting to a number and doesn't explicitly check for `NaN` or non-numeric strings, it could bypass validation logic.
    *   Boolean flags like `--debug` are implicitly set to `true`. If application logic incorrectly assumes `--debug false` will disable debugging, but `minimist` only recognizes `--debug` (or `--debug=true`), it can lead to unintended debugging features being enabled in production.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Logic Flaws
    *   Input Validation Bypass
    *   Information Disclosure (potentially, if logic flaws expose sensitive data or enable unintended features)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the complexity of application logic and reliance on specific parsing behavior for security-critical features.  Can be High if input validation is bypassed leading to significant security issues).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Testing:**  Extensively test argument parsing with various inputs, including edge cases, special characters, and unexpected types, to understand *exactly* how `minimist` behaves in different scenarios.
    *   **Explicit Argument Handling & Type Checking:**  Do not rely on implicit parsing behavior. Explicitly check and convert argument types *after* `minimist` parsing.  Validate the *type* and *format* of parsed arguments within your application code.
    *   **Input Validation (Post-Parsing):**  Always validate the *parsed* arguments against expected formats, types, and ranges. Do not assume `minimist`'s parsing is sufficient for security. Treat `minimist` as a raw input processor, and implement your own robust validation.
    *   **Documentation Review:**  Carefully review `minimist`'s documentation to fully understand its parsing rules and nuances.  However, testing is more crucial than solely relying on documentation, as behavior can sometimes be subtle.
