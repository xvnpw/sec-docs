# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, minimist, is a utility library for parsing command-line arguments in JavaScript. It is designed to be a small, portable, and dependency-free module that can be easily integrated into other Node.js projects or used in browser environments.

Business priorities for a library like minimist are:
- Stability: The library should be reliable and function as expected across different environments and Node.js versions.
- Compatibility: It should be compatible with a wide range of Node.js versions and browser environments.
- Performance:  Argument parsing should be efficient and not introduce significant overhead to applications using it.
- Security: The library must be free from vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious command-line arguments.
- Maintainability: The codebase should be easy to understand and maintain, allowing for timely security updates and bug fixes.

The primary business goal is to provide a robust and secure command-line argument parsing solution that developers can confidently use in their projects.

Most important business risks related to minimist:
- Dependency Risk: Applications depend on minimist. If minimist has a vulnerability, all dependent applications are potentially vulnerable.
- Supply Chain Risk: If the minimist package on npm is compromised, applications using it could be affected.
- Reputation Risk: If a security vulnerability is found in minimist, it could damage the reputation of projects that rely on it and the maintainers of minimist.
- Availability Risk: If a vulnerability causes crashes or denial of service in applications using minimist, it can impact the availability of those applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code review - The project is open source and available on GitHub, allowing for community code review. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
- security control: Automated testing - The project includes unit tests to verify functionality. (Implemented: GitHub Actions, package.json scripts)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Dependency vulnerabilities - As a library, minimist itself has minimal dependencies, reducing direct dependency vulnerability risks. However, vulnerabilities in the Node.js runtime or environment where it is used are accepted risks.
- accepted risk: Input validation complexity -  Minimist provides basic argument parsing but relies on the consuming application to perform higher-level input validation and sanitization based on the application's specific needs. The risk of improper input validation in consuming applications is accepted.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Dependency scanning - Although minimist has minimal dependencies, dependency scanning can help ensure no unexpected or vulnerable dependencies are introduced in the future.
- security control: Security focused code review - Conduct specific security focused code reviews, especially when introducing new features or modifying core parsing logic.
- security control: Signed releases - Sign npm package releases to enhance supply chain security and verify package integrity.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable to a library like minimist. Authentication is handled by the applications that use minimist.
- Authorization: Not applicable to a library like minimist. Authorization is handled by the applications that use minimist based on the parsed arguments.
- Input validation: Minimist itself performs basic parsing of command-line arguments. Security-critical input validation must be implemented by the applications that use minimist to interpret and process the parsed arguments. Minimist should avoid introducing vulnerabilities through its parsing logic, such as injection flaws or denial of service.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to minimist. Cryptographic operations would be handled by the applications using minimist if needed based on the parsed arguments. Minimist itself should not implement or require cryptographic functions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process:
- Secure command-line argument parsing in applications. Minimist indirectly supports the functionality and security of applications that rely on command-line interfaces. If minimist is vulnerable, applications using it can be vulnerable.

Data sensitivity:
- Command-line arguments can contain sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, file paths, and user-provided input. Minimist itself processes these arguments but does not store or manage them. The sensitivity of data handled by minimist depends entirely on how it is used by consuming applications. If applications pass sensitive data through command-line arguments and rely on minimist to parse them, then minimist becomes part of the sensitive data handling process.

Data we are trying to protect:
- Integrity of the minimist library itself: Ensuring that the code is not tampered with and remains free from vulnerabilities.
- Availability of the minimist library: Ensuring that the library is available for developers to use and applications to depend on.
- Confidentiality and integrity of data processed by applications using minimist: While minimist doesn't directly handle sensitive data storage, it plays a role in how applications process command-line inputs, which can include sensitive data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended scope of security responsibility for the minimist library maintainers versus the applications that use it?
- Are there specific types of applications or use cases where minimist is most commonly used? Understanding the typical use cases can help prioritize security concerns.
- Are there any known historical security vulnerabilities or concerns related to minimist or similar argument parsing libraries?
- What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in minimist?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a stable, reliable, and secure utility library for the JavaScript ecosystem. Security is a significant non-functional requirement.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are basic (code review, testing). There is an opportunity to enhance security posture by implementing SAST, dependency scanning, and security-focused code reviews. Applications using minimist are responsible for application-level security controls and input validation of parsed arguments.
- DESIGN: The design is simple, focused on a single JavaScript module. Deployment is via NPM registry distribution. The build process can be enhanced with more security checks.
