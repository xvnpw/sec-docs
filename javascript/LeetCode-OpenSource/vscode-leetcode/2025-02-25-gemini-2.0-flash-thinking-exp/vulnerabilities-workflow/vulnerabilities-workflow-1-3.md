### Vulnerability 1: Insecure Cookie Handling in Cookie-Based Login

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Cookie Handling in Cookie-Based Login
*   **Description:**
    The LeetCode VS Code extension, as documented in the README, provides a "Cookie login" method as a workaround for issues with the standard login process to leetcode.com. This method likely involves users manually providing their session cookies obtained from their browser. If the extension does not handle these manually provided cookies securely, it could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts. Specifically, if the extension stores these cookies in plain text or insufficiently protects them, an attacker who gains access to the user's local system or VS Code environment could potentially steal the session cookie. This stolen cookie could then be used to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their LeetCode account.
    Step-by-step to trigger:
    1.  A user uses the "Cookie login" method in the LeetCode VS Code extension as a workaround for login issues.
    2.  The user manually provides their LeetCode session cookie to the extension.
    3.  The extension stores this cookie locally, potentially in VS Code settings, local storage, or a configuration file.
    4.  If this storage is not properly secured (e.g., the cookie is stored in plain text or easily decryptable format), an attacker who gains access to the user's machine can retrieve this cookie.
    5.  The attacker can then use this stolen cookie to authenticate to leetcode.com as the victim user, bypassing normal login procedures.

*   **Impact:**
    Unauthorized access to a user's LeetCode account. An attacker could potentially:
    *   View the user's LeetCode profile and personal information.
    *   Access the user's submission history and solutions.
    *   Potentially modify account settings, depending on the permissions granted by the session cookie.
    *   Submit solutions under the guise of the user, potentially impacting their LeetCode standing.
    *   Access any private information or features accessible through a logged-in LeetCode session.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    Based on the provided files (README, CHANGELOG, ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, issue templates, config files, build workflow), there is no explicit mention of any security measures implemented to protect manually provided cookies. The documentation describes the "Cookie login" as a workaround, but does not detail any security considerations for handling these sensitive credentials.  It is likely that the extension stores these cookies without encryption or with weak protection, as security best practices for handling session cookies are not explicitly documented or mentioned in the provided files.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Secure Storage:** The extension should encrypt the session cookies before storing them locally.  Using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms provided by VS Code or the operating system would be recommended.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While less critical for cookies that are presumably obtained from leetcode.com, basic validation of the cookie format could be implemented.
    *   **Limited Logging and Exposure:** Ensure that session cookies are not inadvertently logged or displayed in any extension output, logs, or user interface elements in plain text.
    *   **Security Warning in Documentation:** The documentation for "Cookie login" should include a clear warning about the security risks associated with manual cookie handling and advise users to take precautions to protect their local environment.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The user must choose to use the "Cookie login" method as described in the README.
    *   The attacker needs to gain access to the user's local machine or VS Code environment where the extension stores the cookie. This could be through malware, physical access, or other means of system compromise.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    Without access to the source code, a precise source code analysis is impossible. However, we can infer the potential vulnerable area would be within the code that handles the "Sign In by Cookie" command and the subsequent storage and usage of the provided cookie.
    1.  **Cookie Input:** The code would likely have a function or module that prompts the user to input their session cookie. This could be through an input box in VS Code.
    2.  **Cookie Storage:**  After receiving the cookie, the extension needs to store it for future authenticated requests.  Vulnerable storage locations could include:
        *   VS Code Settings: Storing as a setting, especially if not marked as secret, could lead to plain text storage in the settings.json file.
        *   Local Storage:  If the extension uses local storage APIs, improper handling could lead to insecure storage.
        *   Configuration Files: Writing the cookie to a plain text configuration file within the extension's workspace.
    3.  **Cookie Usage:** The stored cookie is then likely used to authenticate requests to leetcode.com. The security of this part depends on the storage security. If the cookie is compromised due to insecure storage, all subsequent authenticated actions are also compromised.

    **Visualization (Conceptual):**

    ```
    User (Cookie Login) --> [Extension Code: Receives Cookie] --> [Insecure Storage (e.g., Plain Text File)]
                                                                      ^
    Attacker (Local Access) -----------------------------------------|
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:** Install the LeetCode VS Code extension and sign out if currently signed in.
    2.  **Cookie Acquisition:** Manually log in to leetcode.com using a web browser and obtain the session cookie (e.g., `LEETCODE_SESSION` or similar, depending on leetcode.com's cookie names).  This can typically be done through browser developer tools (Application/Storage -> Cookies).
    3.  **Cookie Login in Extension:** In VS Code, initiate the "Sign In" command from the LeetCode extension. Choose the "Cookie login" option (if available, or simulate the process if it requires manual cookie input via a command). Paste the copied session cookie into the extension's input prompt.
    4.  **Verify Successful Login:** Confirm that you are successfully logged into your LeetCode account within the VS Code extension. Check if your LeetCode username is displayed in the extension's status bar or explorer.
    5.  **Locate Cookie Storage:** Investigate where the extension might be storing the provided cookie. Check:
        *   VS Code Settings (`settings.json` - Workspace and User settings).
        *   VS Code Local Storage (less likely to be directly accessible without extension code access).
        *   Any files within the extension's workspace or VS Code extension directories that might store configuration or data.
    6.  **Examine Cookie Storage Security:** If you find the stored cookie, examine its format. Is it encrypted or obfuscated in any way? If the cookie is stored in plain text or in a trivially decodable format, this confirms insecure storage.
    7.  **Session Hijacking Test:**
        *   **Retrieve Stored Cookie:** Obtain the plain text (or easily decoded) cookie from the storage location identified in the previous step.
        *   **Clear Extension Data (Simulate New Environment):**  Uninstall and reinstall the LeetCode VS Code extension or attempt to clear its data/settings if possible within VS Code. This step simulates an attacker getting the cookie from a compromised system and then trying to use it on a different system or after the original session might have expired locally.
        *   **Manual Cookie Injection (or Re-Login with Stolen Cookie):** If the extension has a mechanism to re-enter a cookie (like the "Cookie login" command), use the stolen cookie to log in. If not, try to manually inject the cookie back into the storage location (if feasible and if you can identify how the extension uses it).
        *   **Verify Hijacked Session:** After injecting the stolen cookie, verify if you are successfully logged into the LeetCode extension *as the original user* without providing standard login credentials. If successful, this demonstrates session hijacking due to insecure cookie handling.

This test case will help to validate if the "Cookie login" method in the LeetCode VS Code extension introduces a vulnerability due to insecure cookie handling.
