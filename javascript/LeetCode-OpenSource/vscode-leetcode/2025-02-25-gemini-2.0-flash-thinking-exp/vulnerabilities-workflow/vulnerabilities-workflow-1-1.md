## Vulnerability List

There are no identified vulnerabilities of high or critical rank in the provided project files.

The provided files consist primarily of documentation, configuration files, and issue templates for a VS Code extension. Source code for the extension itself is not included in these files. Therefore, a detailed source code analysis to identify vulnerabilities is not possible based on the given information.

The documentation mentions a workaround for login issues with leetcode.com, but this relates to changes on the LeetCode website and not a vulnerability introduced by this project's files.

If source code was provided, potential areas for vulnerability analysis would include authentication mechanisms, data handling, and integration with external services. However, with the current files, no such analysis can be performed to identify vulnerabilities introduced by the project.

Therefore, based on the provided PROJECT FILES, there are no vulnerabilities to report that meet the specified criteria (high rank, valid, not mitigated, introduced by the project, and exploitable by an external attacker).
