- **Vulnerability Name:** Unpinned GitHub Actions Dependencies Vulnerability  
  **Description:**  
  The project’s CI/CD workflow (in `.github/workflows/build.yml`) uses GitHub Actions referenced by version tags (for example, `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/setup-node@v2`) instead of pinning them to immutable commit hashes. An external attacker who manages to influence the upstream actions may have the opportunity to inject malicious code into the build process. For example, if a vulnerability or malicious change is introduced into a later version within the v2 tag range, every workflow run that does not use a specific commit is at risk.  
  **Impact:**  
  - An attacker could compromise the build process to inject malicious payloads into the VS Code extension package.  
  - This supply chain attack can potentially lead to the distribution of a compromised extension to end users.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - None apparent. The workflow file directly references public actions by tag (e.g., `@v2`) without further inspection or commit pinning.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Pin each GitHub Action to a specific, verified commit hash (e.g., `actions/checkout@v2.3.5`).  
  - Incorporate automated security scanners to monitor for changes in upstream actions.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The repository accepts external pull requests and runs workflows automatically.  
  - An attacker must be able to influence or inject a pull request that causes the CI workflow to fetch a compromised version of an action.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `.github/workflows/build.yml` the following steps are used:  
    - **Checkout Step:**  
      ```yaml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      ```  
      This tag reference means any update tagged “v2” (even if malicious) could be pulled in.  
    - **Setup Node.js Step:**  
      ```yaml
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      ```  
      Like the checkout action, this tag is not pinned to a commit hash, opening up a potential attack window.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Fork the repository and modify the workflow file to simulate an “upstream” malicious action (for testing purposes, replace one of the actions with a custom action that logs unexpected behavior).  
  2. Open a pull request from the fork, triggering the CI pipeline on GitHub.  
  3. Monitor the CI job logs and examine whether the altered action is executed and whether its output can be manipulated to simulate code injection.  
  4. Verify that using a pinned commit in place of the tag prevents the simulated malicious behavior.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Cookie‑Based Login Handling  
  **Description:**  
  To work around login issues with the LeetCode endpoint, the extension offers a cookie‑based login method. According to the README and changelog entries, users are instructed to supply cookie values manually when choosing this option. However, there is no evidence in the project files of robust input validation, sanitization, or secure storage routines for handling these cookies. An attacker who is able to influence the cookie data (for example, through phishing or by getting a user to input manipulated data) might craft a cookie string designed to cause unexpected behavior in the authentication logic.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Attackers could hijack sessions or impersonate users if the login mechanism accepts malformed or injected cookie data.  
  - Compromised accounts may lead to unauthorized access to user LeetCode information and potentially to further actions within the extension.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The documentation provides steps for using cookie-based login, but there is no code-level evidence (in the provided project files) of proper sanitization, strict format checking, or secure storage practices for cookie data.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for any cookie values received.  
  - Ensure that cookie data is stored using secure flags (e.g., HTTPOnly, Secure) if applicable.  
  - Consider adding cryptographic integrity checks on stored cookie data.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The user must choose the “Cookie login” workaround.  
  - An attacker must be able to either influence the cookie value entry (for example, via social engineering or by intercepting instructions) or supply a manipulated cookie payload.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The README instructs users on “Cookie login” and refers to a previously reported issue ([issue comment](https://github.com/LeetCode-OpenSource/vscode-leetcode/issues/478#issuecomment-564757098)).  
  - The changelog shows that the cookie login method was “re-added,” implying a custom implementation exists.  
  - No accompanying code or safeguards are visible in the project files; hence, the absence of visible validation routines raises concern.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. On a test instance of the extension, choose the cookie-based login method as documented.  
  2. Supply a cookie value that includes unexpected characters or an injection payload (e.g., strings that mimic code injection or delimiter abuse).  
  3. Observe whether the authentication process accepts the value without error or if it exhibits anomalous behavior (e.g., logging injection attempts, misrouting authentication requests).  
  4. Confirm that an attacker-controlled cookie value leads to session hijacking or unauthorized access.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unvalidated Endpoint Configuration Injection  
  **Description:**  
  The extension supports switching between LeetCode endpoints via the configuration setting `leetcode.endpoint`. The README and documentation state that only “leetcode.com” and “leetcode.cn” are supported; however, there is no visible enforcement mechanism in the project files to restrict the endpoint value to these allowed domains. If users (or a malicious actor) can modify the extension’s configuration, an attacker could substitute a custom endpoint under their control. This change would cause the extension to communicate with an attacker‑controlled server rather than the legitimate LeetCode server.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Users might inadvertently connect to a malicious server, resulting in phishing attacks or credential harvesting.  
  - The attacker may intercept sensitive authentication tokens and LeetCode data, leading to further account compromise.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The documentation clearly states the supported endpoints but does not indicate that runtime validation is performed to enforce these limits in the code.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Enforce strict validation of the `leetcode.endpoint` setting so that only “leetcode.com” and “leetcode.cn” are accepted.  
  - If possible, implement server-side certificate pinning or similar checks when connecting to the endpoints.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - An attacker must be able to modify the extension’s configuration settings (for example, through a misconfigured settings file or via social engineering the user).  
  - The user then chooses to sign in with the malconfigured endpoint.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - Both the English `README.md` and the Chinese documentation (`docs/README_zh-CN.md`) list the supported endpoints along with instructions for switching endpoints.  
  - There is no accompanying code (in the provided files) that enforces a whitelist of endpoints, implying that an arbitrary string could be set via the `leetcode.endpoint` configuration.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Modify the extension’s configuration (for example, via a custom settings file or direct settings injection) to set `leetcode.endpoint` to a domain controlled by an attacker (e.g., `malicious.example.com`).  
  2. Start the extension and trigger the sign‑in process.  
  3. Monitor network traffic to determine whether the extension attempts to connect to the attacker‑controlled endpoint.  
  4. Verify whether user credentials or session data are transmitted to the malicious endpoint.  
  5. Ensure that proper validation (e.g., error message or blocked connection) is not in place, confirming the vulnerability.
