## Consolidated Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities in the LeetCode VS Code extension project, based on the provided information and documentation. These vulnerabilities are ranked as high severity and require attention to mitigate potential security risks.

### 1. Unpinned GitHub Actions Dependencies Vulnerability

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Unpinned GitHub Actions Dependencies Vulnerability
*   **Description:**
    The projectâ€™s CI/CD workflow, located in `.github/workflows/build.yml`, utilizes GitHub Actions by referencing version tags (e.g., `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/setup-node@v2`) instead of immutable commit hashes. This practice introduces a significant security risk. If an attacker manages to compromise an upstream action, or if a vulnerability is introduced in a later version within the tag range, the project's build process becomes vulnerable. Any workflow run relying on these tags could inadvertently pull in and execute malicious code. This vulnerability is triggered when the CI workflow executes and fetches the latest version associated with a tag instead of a specific, unchanging commit.
*   **Impact:**
    - An attacker could compromise the build process to inject malicious payloads directly into the VS Code extension package.
    - This constitutes a supply chain attack, potentially leading to the distribution of a compromised extension to unsuspecting end users.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None are currently implemented. The workflow file directly references public actions using version tags (like `@v2`) without any mechanism for verification or commit pinning to ensure integrity.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Pin GitHub Actions to Specific Commit Hashes:**  Each GitHub Action dependency in the workflow should be pinned to a specific, verified commit hash. For example, instead of `actions/checkout@v2`, it should be `actions/checkout@<commit_hash>`. This ensures that the workflow always uses a known and trusted version of the action.
    - **Implement Automated Security Scanning:** Incorporate automated security scanners into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor for changes or potential vulnerabilities in upstream actions. This can provide early warnings if dependencies become compromised.
*   **Preconditions:**
    - The repository must accept external pull requests and have CI workflows configured to run automatically on these pull requests.
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence or submit a pull request that triggers the CI workflow. Although direct injection via pull request might be difficult for this specific vulnerability, the risk lies in the potential compromise of the upstream actions themselves.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Examining the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file reveals the following vulnerable steps:
        - **Checkout Step:**
          ```yaml
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          ```
          The use of `@v2` tag means the workflow will always fetch the latest version tagged as `v2`, which could change and potentially become compromised without the project's awareness.
        - **Setup Node.js Step:**
          ```yaml
          - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          ```
          Similar to the checkout action, using the `@v2` tag for the Node.js setup also introduces the risk of using a potentially compromised or vulnerable version.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[GitHub Workflow Execution] --> B{Fetch GitHub Action using Tag (e.g., @v2)};
        B -- Tag resolves to latest version --> C[Execute Action Code];
        C -- Potential Malicious Code if Upstream Compromised --> D[Compromised Build Process];
        D --> E[Malicious Extension Package];
        E --> F[Distribution to Users];
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Fork and Modify Workflow:** Fork the repository. In the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file within your fork, replace one of the action uses (e.g., `actions/checkout@v2`) with a reference to a custom action you control or a simple script that logs a specific message. This simulates a malicious action.
    2. **Create Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your fork to the original repository. This will trigger the CI pipeline on the original repository's GitHub instance.
    3. **Monitor CI Job Logs:** Observe the logs of the CI job triggered by your pull request. Check if the modified action (or your custom script) is executed. Look for the log message you added in your simulated malicious action.
    4. **Verify Impact:** If your simulated malicious action was executed as part of the workflow in the original repository, it demonstrates that using tags allows for potential code injection.
    5. **Test Mitigation (Commit Pinning):** Modify the workflow in your fork again. This time, replace the tag (e.g., `@v2`) with a specific commit hash for the same action (you can find commit hashes on the action's GitHub repository). Create another pull request.
    6. **Verify Mitigation:** Monitor the CI job logs for this new pull request. Confirm that the workflow now uses the specific commit hash and that your simulated malicious action (if still present) is no longer effective in injecting code from a potentially compromised "latest" version of the action.

### 2. Insecure Cookie Handling in Cookie-Based Login

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Cookie Handling in Cookie-Based Login
*   **Description:**
    The LeetCode VS Code extension offers a "Cookie login" method as a workaround for login issues, where users manually provide their session cookies from leetcode.com. If these cookies are not handled securely by the extension, it could lead to unauthorized account access.  Specifically, if the extension stores these manually provided cookies in plain text or with insufficient protection locally, an attacker gaining access to the user's system or VS Code environment could steal the session cookie. This stolen cookie could then be used to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their LeetCode account, bypassing normal login procedures. This vulnerability is triggered when a user chooses to use the cookie-based login and the extension stores the provided cookie insecurely.
    Step-by-step to trigger:
    1.  A user utilizes the "Cookie login" method within the LeetCode VS Code extension.
    2.  The user manually inputs their LeetCode session cookie into the extension.
    3.  The extension stores this cookie locally, potentially in VS Code settings, local storage, or a configuration file.
    4.  If this storage is not adequately secured (e.g., plain text storage or easily decryptable format), an attacker with local system access can retrieve the cookie.
    5.  The attacker can then use the stolen cookie to authenticate to leetcode.com as the victim user.
*   **Impact:**
    Unauthorized access to the user's LeetCode account, enabling an attacker to:
    - View the user's LeetCode profile and personal information.
    - Access the user's submission history and solutions.
    - Potentially modify account settings.
    - Submit solutions under the user's identity.
    - Access any private information or features accessible via a logged-in LeetCode session.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    Based on the provided project files (documentation, configuration, issue templates, build workflow), there is no evidence of security measures to protect manually provided cookies. The documentation mentions "Cookie login" as a workaround but lacks details on secure handling of these credentials. It's likely the extension stores cookies without proper encryption or security best practices.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Secure Storage:** Implement robust encryption for session cookies before local storage, utilizing platform-specific secure storage mechanisms provided by VS Code or the operating system.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While less critical for cookies obtained from leetcode.com, basic format validation could be added.
    - **Limit Logging and Exposure:** Prevent accidental logging or display of session cookies in plain text in extension outputs, logs, or UI.
    - **Security Warning in Documentation:** Include a clear warning in the "Cookie login" documentation about security risks and advise users to secure their local environment.
*   **Preconditions:**
    - User must opt for the "Cookie login" method.
    - An attacker must gain access to the user's local machine or VS Code environment where the extension stores the cookie (e.g., via malware or physical access).
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    Without source code, analysis is inferential. Vulnerable areas likely include:
    1.  **Cookie Input Handling:** Code that prompts for and receives the session cookie, possibly via a VS Code input box.
    2.  **Cookie Storage:**  Code that stores the cookie for future authentication. Insecure storage locations could be:
        - VS Code Settings (if not marked as secret, leading to plain text in `settings.json`).
        - Local Storage APIs (improper use can lead to insecure storage).
        - Plain text configuration files within the extension's workspace.
    3.  **Cookie Usage:** Code that uses the stored cookie for authentication. Compromised storage directly leads to compromised authenticated actions.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User (Cookie Login)] --> B[Extension Code: Receives Cookie];
        B --> C[Insecure Storage (e.g., Plain Text File)];
        C -- Stored Cookie --> D[Extension Uses Cookie for Auth];
        D -- Compromised Auth if Cookie Stolen --> E[LeetCode Account Access];
        F[Attacker (Local Access)] --> C;
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:** Install and sign out of the LeetCode VS Code extension.
    2.  **Cookie Acquisition:** Log in to leetcode.com in a browser and obtain the session cookie (e.g., `LEETCODE_SESSION`) from browser developer tools (Application/Storage -> Cookies).
    3.  **Cookie Login in Extension:** In VS Code, initiate "Sign In" in the extension and choose "Cookie login". Paste the copied cookie into the prompt.
    4.  **Verify Login:** Confirm successful login within the extension (username displayed).
    5.  **Locate Cookie Storage:** Check for stored cookies in:
        - VS Code Settings (`settings.json`).
        - Potentially extension workspace or directories.
    6.  **Examine Storage Security:** If found, check if the cookie is encrypted or obfuscated. Plain text storage indicates insecurity.
    7.  **Session Hijacking Test:**
        - **Retrieve Stored Cookie:** Obtain the plain text (or decoded) cookie from storage.
        - **Simulate New Environment:** Reinstall the extension or clear its data to simulate a new environment.
        - **Inject Stolen Cookie:** If possible, use "Cookie login" again with the stolen cookie. Otherwise, attempt to manually inject it back into the storage location if identified.
        - **Verify Hijacked Session:** Confirm successful login as the original user without standard credentials. Success demonstrates session hijacking due to insecure cookie handling.

### 3. Unvalidated Endpoint Configuration Injection

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Unvalidated Endpoint Configuration Injection
*   **Description:**
    The extension allows users to switch between LeetCode endpoints via the `leetcode.endpoint` configuration setting. While documentation mentions only "leetcode.com" and "leetcode.cn" as supported, there's no apparent code-level enforcement to restrict endpoint values. An attacker who can modify the extension's configuration could substitute a malicious endpoint under their control. This would redirect the extension's communication to the attacker's server instead of the legitimate LeetCode server. This vulnerability is triggered when a user, either willingly or unknowingly (due to attacker manipulation), configures the extension to use a malicious endpoint.
*   **Impact:**
    - Users might inadvertently connect to a malicious server, leading to phishing attacks and credential harvesting.
    - Attackers could intercept sensitive authentication tokens and LeetCode data, resulting in account compromise.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Documentation states supported endpoints, but no runtime validation enforces these limits in the code.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Endpoint Validation:** Implement strict validation for the `leetcode.endpoint` setting, allowing only "leetcode.com" and "leetcode.cn". Reject any other values and display an error message.
    - **Server-Side Certificate Pinning:** If feasible, implement server-side certificate pinning or similar checks when connecting to the configured endpoints to further ensure connection to legitimate LeetCode servers.
*   **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to modify the extensionâ€™s configuration settings. This could be through:
        - Misconfigured settings files.
        - Social engineering to trick the user into changing the setting.
        - Potentially through other vulnerabilities allowing configuration manipulation.
    - The user then attempts to sign in or use the extension with the maliciously configured endpoint.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Documentation (`README.md`, `docs/README_zh-CN.md`) lists supported endpoints and instructions for switching.
    - No visible code enforces a whitelist of endpoints, suggesting arbitrary strings can be set via `leetcode.endpoint`.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Configures Endpoint] --> B{Extension Reads leetcode.endpoint};
        B -- No Validation --> C[Connect to Configured Endpoint];
        C -- Malicious Endpoint Configured --> D[Connect to Attacker Server];
        D --> E[Data Interception & Credential Harvesting];
        E --> F[Account Compromise];
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Modify Configuration:** Alter the extensionâ€™s configuration (e.g., via a custom settings file or direct settings injection) to set `leetcode.endpoint` to a domain you control (e.g., `malicious.example.com`).
    2. **Start Extension and Sign-in:** Launch the extension and initiate the sign-in process.
    3. **Monitor Network Traffic:** Use network monitoring tools (like Wireshark or browser developer tools) to observe network traffic. Check if the extension attempts to connect to `malicious.example.com`.
    4. **Verify Data Transmission (Malicious Endpoint):** If connection to the malicious endpoint is confirmed, further examine network traffic to see if user credentials or session data are transmitted to this endpoint.
    5. **Confirm Lack of Validation:** Verify that no error message is displayed by the extension indicating an invalid endpoint and that the connection attempt to the malicious endpoint proceeds without being blocked. This confirms the absence of endpoint validation.
