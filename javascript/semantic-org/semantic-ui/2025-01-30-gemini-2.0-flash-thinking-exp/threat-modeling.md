# Threat Model Analysis for semantic-org/semantic-ui

## Threat: [XSS through Unsanitized User Input in Components](./threats/xss_through_unsanitized_user_input_in_components.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by providing unsanitized input that is then rendered by a Semantic UI component. This occurs when developers fail to properly sanitize user-provided data before displaying it within Semantic UI elements. For example, using a Semantic UI `card` component to display user-generated descriptions without escaping HTML entities could allow an attacker to inject `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` within the description, leading to XSS when the card is rendered.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious websites for users viewing the injected content.

**Affected Semantic UI Component:** Potentially affects any component that renders user-supplied data, including: `form`, `comment`, `modal`, `dropdown`, `popup`, `card`, `list`, `table`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Output Encoding:**  Always encode user-supplied data for HTML output before rendering it within Semantic UI components. Use appropriate escaping functions provided by your server-side language or client-side framework.
*   **Templating Engine Auto-escaping:** Leverage templating engines that offer automatic HTML escaping by default to minimize the risk of developers forgetting to sanitize output.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to further mitigate XSS risks by controlling the sources from which scripts can be executed and other browser behaviors.

## Threat: [DOM-Based XSS via Semantic UI JavaScript Manipulation](./threats/dom-based_xss_via_semantic_ui_javascript_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate client-side data or craft malicious URLs that, when processed by Semantic UI's JavaScript code, result in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the user's browser. This can happen if Semantic UI's JavaScript components use insecure methods to handle client-side data, such as directly using URL fragments (`location.hash`) or other browser-provided inputs to modify the DOM without proper validation. For example, a custom Semantic UI module might incorrectly use `location.hash` to dynamically load content, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript through a crafted URL hash.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, defacement, redirection, similar to other XSS attacks.

**Affected Semantic UI Component:** Potentially affects custom Semantic UI modules or modifications to existing modules, especially those that handle routing, URL parameters, dynamic content loading, or DOM manipulation based on client-side inputs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure JavaScript Coding Practices:**  Thoroughly review and secure any custom JavaScript code that interacts with Semantic UI and manipulates the DOM. Avoid directly using untrusted client-side data for DOM modifications.
*   **Input Validation in JavaScript:** If client-side data must be used for DOM manipulation, rigorously validate and sanitize this data within your JavaScript code before using it with Semantic UI components.
*   **Minimize Client-Side DOM Manipulation:** Limit the amount of DOM manipulation performed by client-side JavaScript, especially when dealing with external or user-controlled data sources.

## Threat: [Using Outdated Semantic UI Version with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/using_outdated_semantic_ui_version_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Utilizing an outdated version of Semantic UI exposes the application to publicly known security vulnerabilities that have been addressed in newer releases. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise the application. For instance, if a past version of Semantic UI had an XSS vulnerability in a specific module that is publicly documented, applications using that outdated version become vulnerable to this specific attack.

**Impact:** Exposure to known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to XSS, DOM manipulation attacks, or other client-side exploits depending on the nature of the vulnerability. This can result in full compromise of the client-side application and user data.

**Affected Semantic UI Component:** Potentially affects any component depending on the specific vulnerability present in the outdated version of Semantic UI. Vulnerabilities can exist in JavaScript modules, CSS, or even the overall framework structure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regular Semantic UI Updates:**  Establish a process for regularly updating Semantic UI to the latest stable version. Monitor Semantic UI's release notes and security advisories for announcements of security patches.
*   **Dependency Management and Monitoring:** Implement a robust dependency management system to track Semantic UI and its dependencies. Use automated tools to monitor for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies and receive alerts for necessary updates.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of your application, including the client-side components and frameworks like Semantic UI, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
