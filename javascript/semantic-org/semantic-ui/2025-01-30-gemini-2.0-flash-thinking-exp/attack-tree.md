## Attack Tree Path: [**1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Semantic UI Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_via_semantic_ui_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. It encompasses all potential attack vectors related to Semantic UI that could lead to compromising the application.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:** Exploiting client-side vulnerabilities, dependency issues, configuration errors, usage mistakes, Semantic UI specific bugs, and supply chain vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [**2. [CRITICAL NODE] 1. Client-Side Exploits via Semantic UI Components [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__1__client-side_exploits_via_semantic_ui_components__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within Semantic UI's client-side components (JavaScript and CSS) to execute malicious code in users' browsers.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:** Primarily focuses on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising from how Semantic UI handles input and manipulates the DOM.

## Attack Tree Path: [**3. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Component Input Handling [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__1_1__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_component_input_handling__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a major category of client-side exploits. Attackers aim to inject malicious scripts through user inputs that are processed and rendered by Semantic UI components without proper sanitization.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:** Exploiting unsanitized user input, vulnerabilities in Semantic UI's JavaScript event handlers, and potentially CSS injection leading to XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [**4. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.1. Exploit Unsanitized User Input in Semantic UI Components [HIGH RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/4___high_risk_path__1_1_1__exploit_unsanitized_user_input_in_semantic_ui_components__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into input fields, forms, or other components. If the application fails to sanitize this input before rendering it within Semantic UI components, the script can execute in the user's browser.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High (Full XSS, account takeover, data theft)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insight:** Sanitize user inputs before rendering them within Semantic UI components.

## Attack Tree Path: [**5. [CRITICAL NODE] 2. Dependency Exploits [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical_node__2__dependency_exploits__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in external JavaScript libraries that are either dependencies of Semantic UI (less likely for core Semantic UI) or are used by the application and interact with Semantic UI.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in JavaScript dependencies, either those directly used by Semantic UI extensions or those used by the application itself that interact with Semantic UI.

## Attack Tree Path: [**6. [CRITICAL NODE] 2.1. Vulnerable JavaScript Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/6___critical_node__2_1__vulnerable_javascript_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on the risk of using JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:**  Vulnerable libraries that Semantic UI might rely on (especially extensions) and vulnerable libraries used by the application that interact with Semantic UI.

## Attack Tree Path: [**7. [HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.2. Application's Code Introduces Vulnerable Libraries Interacting with Semantic UI [HIGH RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/7___high_risk_path__2_1_2__application's_code_introduces_vulnerable_libraries_interacting_with_seman_96df3edd.md)

*   **Description:** The application development team might introduce other JavaScript libraries that, when used in conjunction with Semantic UI, create a vulnerability. This could be due to vulnerabilities in these libraries themselves or insecure interactions between them and Semantic UI.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Depends on the vulnerability, could be XSS, RCE, etc.)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insight:** Conduct security reviews of all JavaScript libraries used in the application, especially those interacting with Semantic UI components or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [**8. [CRITICAL NODE] 3. Configuration and Usage Errors [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/8___critical_node__3__configuration_and_usage_errors__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might misconfigure Semantic UI components or use them in insecure ways, leading to vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:** Insecure component configurations leading to information disclosure, using components in insecure contexts, and vulnerabilities introduced through insecure customizations or extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [**9. [HIGH RISK PATH] 3.1.2. Using Semantic UI Components in Insecure Contexts [HIGH RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/9___high_risk_path__3_1_2__using_semantic_ui_components_in_insecure_contexts__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Placing Semantic UI components in parts of the application that are inherently vulnerable or handling untrusted data without proper security measures can amplify existing vulnerabilities. For example, displaying user-controlled content without encoding within a Semantic UI modal.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Can amplify existing vulnerabilities, potentially XSS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insight:** Consider the security context when using Semantic UI components. Ensure they are not used to display or handle untrusted data without proper security measures in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [**10. [HIGH RISK PATH] 3.2. Insecure Customizations and Extensions [HIGH RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/10___high_risk_path__3_2__insecure_customizations_and_extensions__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers often customize or extend Semantic UI using custom JavaScript or CSS. Vulnerabilities can be introduced in this custom code if secure coding practices are not followed.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:** Vulnerabilities in custom JavaScript or CSS code extending Semantic UI, and insecurely overriding Semantic UI defaults.

## Attack Tree Path: [**11. [HIGH RISK PATH] 3.2.1. Vulnerabilities in Custom JS/CSS Extending Semantic UI [HIGH RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/11___high_risk_path__3_2_1__vulnerabilities_in_custom_jscss_extending_semantic_ui__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  Custom JavaScript or CSS code written to extend Semantic UI's functionality or styling might contain vulnerabilities such as XSS, logic flaws, or other security weaknesses.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Depends on the vulnerability, could be XSS, logic flaws)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insight:** Apply secure coding practices when creating custom JavaScript or CSS for Semantic UI. Conduct security reviews of custom code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**12. [CRITICAL NODE] 5. Supply Chain Attacks (Less Direct, but Relevant) [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/12___critical_node__5__supply_chain_attacks__less_direct__but_relevant___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Although less direct, the supply chain through which Semantic UI is distributed can be a target. Compromising the distribution channels could allow attackers to inject malicious code into Semantic UI itself.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:** Compromising Semantic UI distribution channels (CDN, package repositories) or the development infrastructure to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**13. [CRITICAL NODE] 5.1. Compromised Semantic UI Distribution [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/13___critical_node__5_1__compromised_semantic_ui_distribution__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on attacks targeting the distribution mechanisms of Semantic UI.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:** Malicious code injected into the CDN or package repositories where Semantic UI is hosted.
