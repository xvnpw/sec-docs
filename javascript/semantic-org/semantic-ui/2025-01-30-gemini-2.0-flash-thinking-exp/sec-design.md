# BUSINESS POSTURE

Semantic UI is an open-source user interface (UI) framework that aims to empower designers and developers to create beautiful, responsive websites and applications. The primary business goal is to provide a reusable, community-driven library of UI components that simplifies front-end development. It prioritizes ease of use, flexibility, and a visually appealing design system.

Key business priorities for Semantic UI include:
- Maintaining a high-quality, well-documented UI framework.
- Fostering a strong and active community of users and contributors.
- Ensuring compatibility with modern web browsers and technologies.
- Providing a customizable and extensible framework to meet diverse project needs.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Community Dependency Risk: Reliance on community contributions for maintenance, updates, and security fixes. A decline in community engagement could lead to stagnation or security vulnerabilities remaining unaddressed.
- Software Quality Risk: Defects or inconsistencies in the framework could negatively impact user experience and project timelines for developers using Semantic UI.
- Security Vulnerability Risk: Security flaws in the framework could be exploited in applications built using Semantic UI, leading to potential data breaches or other security incidents.
- Compatibility Risk: Lack of compatibility with new browsers, devices, or web technologies could limit the framework's usability and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Publicly accessible GitHub repository. This allows for community review of code and potential identification of vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub platform.
- security control: Open-source licensing (MIT License). This promotes transparency and allows for broad usage and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented in: LICENSE file in the repository.
- security control: Issue tracking system on GitHub. Used for reporting bugs and feature requests, which can include security-related issues. Implemented in: GitHub Issues.
- security control: Community contributions and pull requests.  Peer review by community members can help identify potential security issues in code changes. Implemented in: GitHub Pull Request process.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community for security vulnerability discovery and patching. Response time to security issues may vary depending on community activity.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to exist in the codebase due to the complexity of UI framework and community-driven development.
- accepted risk: No formal security audit process is explicitly documented.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Conduct periodic security reviews or penetration testing, potentially engaging external security experts, to identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the build process or framework itself.
- security control:  Promote and enforce secure coding practices among contributors through documentation and code review guidelines.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI framework. Semantic UI itself does not handle user authentication. Applications using Semantic UI will implement their own authentication mechanisms.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a UI framework. Semantic UI components are used to build user interfaces, and authorization logic is implemented within the application using the framework.
- Input Validation: Relevant for UI components that handle user input (e.g., forms, input fields). Semantic UI should encourage or provide mechanisms for developers to easily implement client-side input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS). Security requirement: Ensure that documentation and examples highlight the importance of input validation when using form components.
- Cryptography: Not a primary security requirement for a UI framework itself. However, if Semantic UI provides components that might be used for handling sensitive data (e.g., password input fields), it should follow secure development practices and avoid introducing vulnerabilities. Security requirement: Ensure that any components dealing with sensitive data do not introduce cryptographic weaknesses or vulnerabilities.

## DEPLOYMENT

Semantic UI is typically deployed in a few ways:

1.  **CDN (Content Delivery Network):**  Developers link to Semantic UI CSS and JavaScript files hosted on a CDN. This is a common and convenient method for quick integration.
2.  **Package Managers (npm, Yarn):** Developers install Semantic UI as a dependency in their project using package managers. This allows for more control over versioning and customization.
3.  **Self-Hosting:** Developers download Semantic UI files and host them directly on their own web servers. This provides maximum control but requires more setup.

For detailed description, let's consider **CDN Deployment**:

- Build process and CI/CD pipeline configuration: Confidential, access control is important to prevent unauthorized modifications. Sensitivity: Confidential, Integrity: High.
- Developer credentials and access keys: Confidential, critical to protect against unauthorized access to infrastructure and code repositories. Sensitivity: Confidential, Integrity: High, Availability: High.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- Is there a formal security incident response plan for Semantic UI?
- Are there any specific security testing practices currently in place beyond community code review?
- What is the process for managing and patching vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies?
- Are there any plans to implement automated security scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline?
- Is there a designated security contact or team for the Semantic UI project?

Assumptions:
- Semantic UI project relies heavily on community contributions for security.
- There is no dedicated security team actively monitoring and securing the project.
- Security awareness and secure coding practices among contributors may vary.
- The primary deployment method is CDN or package managers.
- The build process is automated using CI/CD, likely GitHub Actions.
- The project aims to provide a secure and reliable UI framework, but security is not the absolute top priority compared to functionality and ease of use.
