## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Semantic UI and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_semantic_ui_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify the current version of Semantic UI and its dependencies (especially jQuery) used in your project's `package.json` or dependency management files.
    *   Step 2: Check the official Semantic UI GitHub repository or npm page for the latest stable version and release notes.
    *   Step 3: Review release notes for security patches and bug fixes specifically for Semantic UI and its dependencies.
    *   Step 4: Use your package manager (npm, yarn, etc.) to update Semantic UI and its dependencies to the latest stable versions (e.g., `npm update semantic-ui semantic-ui-css jquery`).
    *   Step 5: Test your application after updating to ensure Semantic UI components and functionalities remain compatible and functional.
    *   Step 6: Implement a recurring process for checking and applying Semantic UI updates to benefit from ongoing security improvements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Semantic UI Framework - Severity: High
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Semantic UI Dependencies (e.g., jQuery) - Severity: High
    *   Supply Chain Attacks targeting outdated Semantic UI or dependencies - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities: High reduction - Directly patches known security flaws within Semantic UI and its ecosystem.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated framework components.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Check project documentation and CI/CD pipeline for dependency update processes related to Semantic UI.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if there's no documented process for regularly updating Semantic UI and its dependencies or automated vulnerability scanning focused on these components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Integrity of Semantic UI Assets (SRI)](./mitigation_strategies/verify_integrity_of_semantic_ui_assets__sri_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: If using Semantic UI from a CDN, obtain the Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for Semantic UI CSS and JavaScript files from the CDN provider's documentation.
    *   Step 2: Integrate SRI hashes into your HTML `<link>` and `<script>` tags when including Semantic UI assets from the CDN. Add the `integrity` attribute with the corresponding hash and `crossorigin="anonymous"` for CDN resources.
    *   Step 3: Example:
        ```html
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@2.5.0/dist/semantic.min.css" integrity="sha384-YOUR_SRI_HASH_HERE" crossorigin="anonymous">
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@2.5.0/dist/semantic.min.js" integrity="sha384-YOUR_SRI_HASH_HERE" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        ```
    *   Step 4: If hosting Semantic UI assets locally, generate SRI hashes for your local Semantic UI CSS and JavaScript files using tools like `openssl dgst -sha384 -binary` and `openssl base64`.
    *   Step 5: Use these generated SRI hashes in your HTML when referencing local Semantic UI assets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromised CDN serving Semantic UI assets - Severity: High
    *   Man-in-the-Middle attacks injecting malicious code when loading Semantic UI assets - Severity: High
    *   Unauthorized modification of locally hosted Semantic UI assets - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   CDN/MITM Attacks: High reduction - Prevents the browser from executing tampered Semantic UI assets from compromised CDNs or MITM attacks.
    *   Local Asset Tampering: Medium reduction - Detects unauthorized changes to local Semantic UI files, enabling faster incident response.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Inspect HTML templates for `integrity` attributes on `<link>` and `<script>` tags referencing Semantic UI assets.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if `integrity` attributes are absent from CDN links or if no mechanism is in place to verify the integrity of locally hosted Semantic UI files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Contextual Output Encoding for Dynamic Content in Semantic UI Components](./mitigation_strategies/contextual_output_encoding_for_dynamic_content_in_semantic_ui_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all instances where dynamic data (user input, database content, API responses) is rendered within Semantic UI components (e.g., modals, cards, lists, tables).
    *   Step 2: Determine the HTML context where the dynamic data is inserted within Semantic UI components (e.g., element text content, HTML attribute values).
    *   Step 3: Implement server-side output encoding appropriate for the HTML context *before* passing data to the client-side for rendering in Semantic UI.
        *   For HTML element text content within Semantic UI components: Use HTML entity encoding.
        *   For HTML attribute values within Semantic UI components: Use HTML attribute encoding.
        *   Avoid directly injecting unencoded dynamic data into Semantic UI components using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
    *   Step 4: Utilize server-side templating engines or libraries that automatically handle contextual output encoding when rendering data within Semantic UI templates.
    *   Step 5: Example (conceptual server-side templating):
        ```html
        <div class="ui card">
          <div class="content">
            <div class="header">{{ encoded_product_name }}</div>  <!-- HTML entity encoded product name -->
            <div class="description">{{ encoded_product_description }}</div> <!-- HTML entity encoded description -->
          </div>
        </div>
        ```
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising from dynamic content rendered within Semantic UI - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: High reduction - Prevents injection of malicious scripts through dynamic content displayed by Semantic UI components.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Review server-side code and templating logic for output encoding practices when rendering data for Semantic UI components.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if output encoding is not consistently applied to dynamic content rendered by Semantic UI, especially when displaying user-generated or external data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Input Before Displaying in Semantic UI Components](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_input_before_displaying_in_semantic_ui_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all user input fields that contribute to content displayed within Semantic UI components (e.g., form inputs, comment fields, profile descriptions).
    *   Step 2: Implement robust server-side input sanitization *before* storing or displaying user input that will be rendered by Semantic UI.
    *   Step 3: Use a reputable sanitization library suitable for your backend language (e.g., OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer, Bleach for Python) to process user input.
    *   Step 4: Configure the sanitization library to allow only a safe subset of HTML tags and attributes necessary for basic formatting within Semantic UI components (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`).  Strictly disallow potentially harmful tags like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, and event handlers.
    *   Step 5: Apply sanitization to user input before storing it in the database or displaying it through Semantic UI components.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities through user input displayed in Semantic UI - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: High reduction - Prevents persistent XSS attacks by removing malicious code from user-provided content before it's rendered by Semantic UI.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Examine server-side code for input sanitization logic, particularly in controllers or services handling user input intended for Semantic UI display.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if user input is stored and subsequently displayed in Semantic UI components without server-side sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) tailored for Semantic UI](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__tailored_for_semantic_ui.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define a Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header or meta tag for your application.
    *   Step 2: Configure CSP directives to restrict resource loading sources, specifically considering the origin of Semantic UI assets (CDN or self-hosted).
    *   Step 3: Example CSP directives relevant to Semantic UI:
        *   `default-src 'self'`:  Restrict default resource loading to the application's origin.
        *   `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' cdn.jsdelivr.net`: Allow scripts from the same origin, inline scripts (use cautiously), `unsafe-eval` (avoid if possible), and a CDN like jsdelivr if Semantic UI is loaded from there. Adjust CDN domain as needed.
        *   `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' cdn.jsdelivr.net`: Allow styles from the same origin, inline styles (use cautiously), and the Semantic UI CDN.
        *   `font-src 'self' cdn.jsdelivr.net`: Allow fonts from the same origin and the Semantic UI CDN if fonts are loaded from there.
        *   `img-src 'self' data:`: Allow images from the same origin and data URLs.
    *   Step 4: Implement the CSP by setting the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header in server responses.
    *   Step 5: Test your CSP configuration thoroughly, ensuring Semantic UI components and functionalities are not broken by the policy. Use browser developer tools to identify and resolve CSP violations related to Semantic UI assets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reduces the impact of successful XSS attacks, even if they bypass other defenses related to Semantic UI usage - Severity: High
    *   Data Injection Attacks - Limits the scope of potential data injection vulnerabilities related to Semantic UI rendering - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: High reduction in impact - Limits the actions an attacker can perform even if an XSS vulnerability related to Semantic UI is exploited.
    *   Data Injection Attacks: Medium reduction - Restricts potential malicious data loading or exfiltration related to Semantic UI components.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Check server configuration for `Content-Security-Policy` headers or HTML for `<meta>` tags defining CSP, and review if it's configured considering Semantic UI assets.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if no CSP header or meta tag is configured, or if the existing CSP does not adequately address the loading of Semantic UI assets and potential XSS scenarios related to its usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize and Secure Custom JavaScript Interacting with Semantic UI](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_and_secure_custom_javascript_interacting_with_semantic_ui.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review all custom JavaScript code that interacts with Semantic UI components, manipulates Semantic UI elements, or extends Semantic UI functionality.
    *   Step 2: Minimize the amount of custom JavaScript by leveraging Semantic UI's built-in features and components as much as possible. Reduce reliance on custom scripts that directly manipulate Semantic UI elements.
    *   Step 3: Apply secure coding practices in custom JavaScript that interacts with Semantic UI:
        *   Avoid using `eval()` or similar unsafe JavaScript functions within custom scripts interacting with Semantic UI.
        *   Sanitize or encode user input before dynamically injecting it into Semantic UI components using JavaScript.
        *   Carefully review DOM manipulation logic in custom JavaScript that affects Semantic UI elements to prevent DOM-based XSS.
    *   Step 4: Conduct code reviews specifically focusing on custom JavaScript that interacts with Semantic UI to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities in custom JavaScript interacting with Semantic UI - Severity: Medium to High
    *   DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities introduced through custom JavaScript manipulating Semantic UI elements - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities: High reduction - Reduces the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities in custom code that extends or interacts with Semantic UI.
    *   DOM-based XSS: Medium reduction - Prevents XSS vulnerabilities arising from insecure DOM manipulation within custom JavaScript related to Semantic UI.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Review project code quality practices, code review processes, and static analysis tool usage for custom JavaScript, especially code interacting with Semantic UI.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if there are no specific code review processes for custom JavaScript interacting with Semantic UI or if static analysis tools are not used to scan client-side code for vulnerabilities in these interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure CDN Usage for Semantic UI Assets (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_cdn_usage_for_semantic_ui_assets__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: If using a CDN to serve Semantic UI assets, select a reputable CDN provider known for its security measures and reliability.
    *   Step 2: Always use HTTPS (`https://`) for all CDN links to Semantic UI assets to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks when loading the framework.
    *   Step 3: Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN-hosted Semantic UI assets as described in the "Verify Integrity of Semantic UI Assets (SRI)" mitigation strategy.
    *   Step 4: Review the CDN provider's security policies and incident response procedures.
    *   Step 5: Have a contingency plan in case of CDN outages or security incidents affecting the CDN serving Semantic UI. This might include a fallback to locally hosted Semantic UI assets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromised CDN serving Semantic UI assets - Severity: High
    *   Man-in-the-Middle attacks targeting CDN asset delivery - Severity: High
    *   CDN service disruptions affecting availability of Semantic UI - Severity: Medium (Availability impact, indirectly related to security posture)
*   **Impact:**
    *   CDN/MITM Attacks: High reduction - Mitigates risks associated with using potentially compromised or insecure CDNs for Semantic UI assets.
    *   CDN Service Outages: Medium reduction (availability) - Improves resilience against CDN service disruptions affecting Semantic UI availability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Check HTML templates for CDN links used for Semantic UI, verify HTTPS usage and SRI implementation. Review CDN provider selection criteria and fallback mechanisms.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if CDN links are not using HTTPS, SRI is not implemented for CDN assets, or if there's no fallback strategy for CDN-related issues affecting Semantic UI.
