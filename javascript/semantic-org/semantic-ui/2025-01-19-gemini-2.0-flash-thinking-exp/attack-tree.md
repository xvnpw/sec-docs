# Attack Tree Analysis for semantic-org/semantic-ui

Objective: Successfully execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser or steal sensitive information by exploiting a vulnerability or weakness inherent in the Semantic UI framework or its usage within the application.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application via Semantic UI **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * Exploit JavaScript Vulnerabilities in Semantic UI **(HIGH-RISK PATH START)**
        * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Semantic UI Components **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    * Exploit CSS Vulnerabilities in Semantic UI **(Potentially High-Risk Path)**
        * CSS Injection leading to Information Disclosure or UI Redress **(CRITICAL NODE if leading to credential theft)**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Semantic UI (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_semantic_ui__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of Semantic UI to harm the application or its users. It serves as the root of all potential attack paths related to the framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JavaScript Vulnerabilities in Semantic UI (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_javascript_vulnerabilities_in_semantic_ui__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This category encompasses attacks that leverage flaws in Semantic UI's JavaScript code or its integration, leading to the execution of malicious scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Semantic UI Components (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_semantic_ui_components__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
    * **Identify Vulnerable Component:** The attacker identifies a Semantic UI component (e.g., a search bar, a modal, a data table) that renders user-controlled data without proper sanitization or encoding. This could be data submitted through forms, URL parameters, or retrieved from a database.
    * **Inject Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload. This payload could aim to steal cookies or session tokens, redirect the user to a phishing site, modify the page content, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Trigger Execution:** The attacker injects this payload into the vulnerable component. This could be done by submitting a form with the malicious script, crafting a URL containing the script, or exploiting a stored XSS vulnerability where the script is saved in the application's database.
    * **User Interaction:** When a user interacts with the vulnerable component (e.g., views the page, performs a search, opens a modal), the browser renders the unsanitized data, executing the attacker's JavaScript payload within the user's session.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CSS Vulnerabilities in Semantic UI (Potentially High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_css_vulnerabilities_in_semantic_ui__potentially_high-risk_path_.md)

This category involves attacks that manipulate the styling of the application, potentially leading to information disclosure or tricking users into performing unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [CSS Injection leading to Information Disclosure or UI Redress (CRITICAL NODE if leading to credential theft)](./attack_tree_paths/css_injection_leading_to_information_disclosure_or_ui_redress__critical_node_if_leading_to_credentia_d9fc60e9.md)

**Attack Vector:**
    * **Identify Injection Point:** The attacker finds a way to inject arbitrary CSS into the application's rendered output. This could be through a vulnerability in a server-side component that doesn't properly sanitize CSS input or through a stored XSS vulnerability that allows injecting CSS.
    * **Inject Malicious CSS:** The attacker crafts malicious CSS rules. These rules can be used to:
        * **Overlay Fake UI Elements:**  Create fake login forms or other UI elements that mimic the legitimate application, tricking users into entering their credentials or other sensitive information.
        * **Hide or Reveal Information:** Hide legitimate content or reveal information that should be hidden, potentially leading to data breaches.
        * **Track User Actions:** Use CSS selectors and background image requests to track user interactions and potentially infer sensitive information.
    * **User Interaction:** When the user interacts with the manipulated UI, they might unknowingly submit their credentials to the attacker's fake form or be misled into performing actions they wouldn't otherwise take. If the injected CSS leads to credential theft, the impact becomes critical.
