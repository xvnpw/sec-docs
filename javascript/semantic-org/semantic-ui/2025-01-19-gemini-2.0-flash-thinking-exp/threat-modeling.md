# Threat Model Analysis for semantic-org/semantic-ui

## Threat: [Client-Side Prototype Pollution](./threats/client-side_prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious properties into the prototypes of Semantic UI's internal objects by manipulating user-controlled data that interacts with Semantic UI's JavaScript. This could be achieved by exploiting how Semantic UI handles object merging or extension.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful prototype pollution can lead to various issues, including:
        *   **Code injection:** Modifying the behavior of existing JavaScript code within Semantic UI and potentially the application.
        *   **Bypassing security checks:** Altering internal logic of Semantic UI components to bypass intended security measures.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Causing unexpected errors or crashes within Semantic UI functionality.
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Leaking sensitive data by manipulating object properties used by Semantic UI.
    *   **Affected Component:** JavaScript API, potentially all modules that handle object configurations or extensions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in conjunction with Semantic UI's JavaScript methods or configurations.
        *   Avoid directly manipulating Semantic UI's internal objects or prototypes.
        *   Utilize object freezing or sealing techniques where appropriate to prevent modification of critical Semantic UI objects.
        *   Regularly update Semantic UI to the latest version, as newer versions may include patches for prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the loading of external resources, which can limit the impact of successful prototype pollution.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through DOM Manipulation](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_dom_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application by exploiting how Semantic UI's JavaScript components handle dynamic content rendering or manipulation. If user-supplied data is directly inserted into the DOM using Semantic UI's methods without proper encoding, the attacker's script will be executed in the victim's browser. This directly leverages Semantic UI's functionality to introduce the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Successful XSS can allow an attacker to:
        *   Steal session cookies and hijack user accounts.
        *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
        *   Deface the website by manipulating elements rendered by Semantic UI.
        *   Inject malware.
        *   Log keystrokes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Modules (e.g., `Modal`, `Popup`, `Dropdown`) that dynamically render content, utilities for DOM manipulation provided by Semantic UI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always encode user-provided data before rendering it using Semantic UI components. Utilize appropriate encoding functions based on the context (e.g., HTML escaping for content within HTML elements).
        *   Avoid using Semantic UI's JavaScript methods for directly injecting raw HTML. Prefer using data binding or templating mechanisms that handle encoding automatically.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the risk of XSS by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded and the types of inline scripts that can be executed.
