# Attack Surface Analysis for semantic-org/semantic-ui

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Component Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_component_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious scripts are injected into the application and executed in the user's browser, often by manipulating DOM elements or attributes used by Semantic UI components.
    *   **How Semantic-UI Contributes:** Semantic UI's dynamic nature, relying on JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and component behavior based on attributes (like `data-*`) and classes, can create injection points if user-controlled data is used without proper sanitization.
    *   **Example:**  A malicious user provides input that is directly used to set the `data-tooltip` attribute of a Semantic UI element. This tooltip, when displayed, executes the injected script.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user-provided data before using it to manipulate Semantic UI components or their attributes.
        *   **Contextual Output Encoding:** Encode data appropriately for the context where it's being used (e.g., HTML entity encoding for display in HTML).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   **Avoid Direct DOM Manipulation with User Input:**  Minimize direct manipulation of Semantic UI elements with unsanitized user input. Use framework-provided methods or carefully sanitize before manipulation.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (jQuery)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__jquery_.md)

*   **Description:**  Semantic UI relies on jQuery, and vulnerabilities in jQuery can be exploited in applications using Semantic UI.
    *   **How Semantic-UI Contributes:**  Semantic UI's functionality is built upon jQuery. If jQuery has a security flaw, any application using Semantic UI is potentially vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A known XSS vulnerability exists in a specific version of jQuery. An application using Semantic UI with that vulnerable jQuery version can be attacked using the jQuery vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), or other client-side attacks depending on the specific jQuery vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Semantic UI and its dependencies, especially jQuery, to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and receive alerts for updates.
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** If using a CDN for jQuery, implement SRI to ensure the integrity of the loaded file and prevent malicious alterations.
