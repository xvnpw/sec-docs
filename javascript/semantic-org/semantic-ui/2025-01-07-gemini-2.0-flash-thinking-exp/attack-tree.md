## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Semantic-UI -> Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Semantic-UI Components -> Gain Access to User's Session/Cookies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_semantic-ui_-_exploit_cross-site_scripting__xs_1a65ac6b.md)

- **Identify Input Vectors Processed by Vulnerable Semantic-UI Component [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    - **Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies parts of the application's UI built with Semantic-UI components that accept user input and render it without proper sanitization. This could involve examining the application's source code, using browser developer tools, or through fuzzing techniques. This node is critical because it is the initial step required to inject malicious scripts.
- **Craft Malicious Input Containing JavaScript Payload:**
    - **Attack Vector:** The attacker creates a crafted input string containing malicious JavaScript code. This payload is designed to execute in the victim's browser when the vulnerable Semantic-UI component renders it. The payload might aim to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Trigger Vulnerable Semantic-UI Component with Malicious Input:**
    - **Attack Vector:** The attacker finds a way to deliver the crafted malicious input to the vulnerable Semantic-UI component. This could be through a form submission, a URL parameter, or any other mechanism that allows user-controlled data to reach the component.
- **Execute Malicious JavaScript in User's Browser [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    - **Attack Vector:** When the vulnerable Semantic-UI component renders the attacker's input, the lack of proper sanitization allows the malicious JavaScript code to be interpreted and executed by the user's browser. This node is critical because it signifies the successful injection and execution of the attacker's code.
- **Gain Access to User's Session/Cookies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    - **Attack Vector:** The malicious JavaScript code, now running in the user's browser, can access the browser's cookies, including session cookies. These cookies are often used to authenticate the user, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session. This node is critical due to the severe impact of session hijacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Semantic-UI -> Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Semantic-UI Components -> Perform Actions on Behalf of the User](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_semantic-ui_-_exploit_cross-site_scripting__xs_a0518d80.md)

- **Identify Input Vectors Processed by Vulnerable Semantic-UI Component [CRITICAL NODE]:** (See description above)
- **Craft Malicious Input Containing JavaScript Payload:** (See description above)
- **Trigger Vulnerable Semantic-UI Component with Malicious Input:** (See description above)
- **Execute Malicious JavaScript in User's Browser [CRITICAL NODE]:** (See description above)
- **Perform Actions on Behalf of the User [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    - **Attack Vector:** The malicious JavaScript code can make requests to the application's server as if it were the authenticated user. This allows the attacker to perform actions the user is authorized to do, such as changing settings, making purchases, or accessing sensitive data. This node is critical because it allows the attacker to directly abuse the user's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via Semantic-UI Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_semantic-ui_vulnerabilities.md)

This is the root goal and is inherently critical as it represents the ultimate success of the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Semantic-UI Components](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_semantic-ui_components.md)

This node is critical because XSS vulnerabilities are a common and highly impactful class of web security issues. Successful exploitation can lead to a wide range of attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Identify Input Vectors Processed by Vulnerable Semantic-UI Component](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_identify_input_vectors_processed_by_vulnerable_semantic-ui_component.md)

This node is critical as it's the necessary first step for many client-side attacks, particularly XSS. Without identifying these entry points, the attacker cannot inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Execute Malicious JavaScript in User's Browser](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_execute_malicious_javascript_in_user's_browser.md)

This node is critical because it signifies the successful breach of the client-side security boundary. Once JavaScript is executing in the user's browser, the attacker has significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Gain Access to User's Session/Cookies](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_access_to_user's_sessioncookies.md)

This node is critical due to the high impact of session hijacking, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Perform Actions on Behalf of the User](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_perform_actions_on_behalf_of_the_user.md)

This node is critical because it allows the attacker to directly abuse the user's privileges and potentially cause significant harm.
