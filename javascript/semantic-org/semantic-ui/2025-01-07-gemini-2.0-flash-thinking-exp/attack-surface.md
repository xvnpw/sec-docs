# Attack Surface Analysis for semantic-org/semantic-ui

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Output in Components](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_output_in_components.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by other users' browsers.
    *   **How Semantic UI Contributes:** If Semantic UI components render user-supplied or dynamically generated data without proper encoding or sanitization, it can become a vector for XSS attacks. This includes data used in component options, attributes, or inner HTML.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses a Semantic UI modal to display user comments. If a malicious user includes `<script>alert("XSS");</script>` in their comment and the modal renders this comment without sanitization, the script will execute when another user views the modal.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize or encode user-provided data before rendering it within Semantic UI components. Use appropriate encoding functions based on the context (e.g., HTML entity encoding for displaying in HTML).
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is permitted to load resources. This can help mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.
        *   Regularly review and audit code where user data interacts with Semantic UI components.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS)](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__dom_xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  The vulnerability occurs entirely within the client-side code. Malicious scripts manipulate the DOM structure, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript.
    *   **How Semantic UI Contributes:** If application code interacts with Semantic UI components in a way that allows attacker-controlled data to modify the DOM structure directly (e.g., by manipulating component properties or attributes), it can lead to DOM XSS.
    *   **Example:** Application code uses `$('.ui.search').search({ source: malicious_data });` where `malicious_data` contains JavaScript that gets executed when the search component processes it.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to reflected and stored XSS, including account takeover, data theft, and redirection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly manipulating Semantic UI component options or attributes with untrusted data.
        *   Carefully review any client-side logic that interacts with Semantic UI components and ensures that user-controlled data is not used to construct or modify DOM elements in an unsafe manner.
        *   Use trusted types (if supported by the browser) to enforce security policies on DOM manipulations.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised CDN or Package Repository](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_via_compromised_cdn_or_package_repository.md)

*   **Description:** If the CDN hosting Semantic UI or the package repository (e.g., npm) is compromised, malicious code could be injected into the library files served to the application.
    *   **How Semantic UI Contributes:** Relying on external sources for the library introduces a dependency on the security of those sources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises the CDN hosting Semantic UI and injects malicious JavaScript into the library files. Any application loading Semantic UI from that CDN will now execute the malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially full compromise of the application and its users' data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes when including Semantic UI from a CDN. This ensures that the browser only executes the script if its content matches the expected hash.
        *   Prefer hosting Semantic UI files locally if possible.
        *   Use a private package repository or a dependency firewall to control and scan dependencies.
