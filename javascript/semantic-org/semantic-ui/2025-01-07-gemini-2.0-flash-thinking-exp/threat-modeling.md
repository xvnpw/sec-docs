# Threat Model Analysis for semantic-org/semantic-ui

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Modal Component Vulnerability](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_modal_component_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a modal's content by exploiting a flaw within the `Modal` component itself. This could occur if the component doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided data intended for display within the modal, or if there's a vulnerability in how the modal handles specific attributes or content sources. The injected script executes in the victim's browser when the modal is displayed.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application, and unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Modal` module, specifically how it handles dynamic content injection or attribute rendering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user-provided data on the server-side *before* passing it to the `Modal` component for display.
        *   Ensure the application uses the latest version of Semantic UI with any known XSS vulnerabilities in the `Modal` component patched.
        *   Carefully review any custom logic or extensions that interact with the `Modal` component's content or attributes.

## Threat: [DOM-Based XSS through Dynamic Element Creation within Components](./threats/dom-based_xss_through_dynamic_element_creation_within_components.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within Semantic UI's JavaScript code could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts through the library's own DOM manipulation mechanisms. This happens if Semantic UI components use user-controlled data without proper sanitization when dynamically creating or modifying DOM elements. For example, a component might use user input to set element attributes or content in a way that allows script execution.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to reflected XSS, this can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection, and other malicious activities within the user's browser context.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Various modules and functions within Semantic UI's JavaScript API that manipulate the DOM based on configuration or data, particularly those dealing with dynamic content updates (e.g., potentially within `Dropdown`, `Accordion`, `Tab`, or `Popup` modules if they process unsanitized data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the application uses the latest version of Semantic UI, as updates often include fixes for DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   If extending or customizing Semantic UI components, carefully review the library's source code to understand how it handles DOM manipulation and ensure your customizations do not introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid directly passing unsanitized user input to Semantic UI functions that dynamically create or modify DOM elements.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability in a Critical Transitive Dependency](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_in_a_critical_transitive_dependency.md)

*   **Description:** Semantic UI relies on a limited number of direct dependencies, but those dependencies might have their own dependencies (transitive dependencies). A critical vulnerability in one of these transitive dependencies could be exploited through the application's use of Semantic UI if the vulnerable code is executed within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, potentially compromising the entire application and server.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Indirectly affects the entire library and the application using it. The vulnerability resides within the transitive dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the CVSS score and exploitability of the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit the application's dependency tree, including Semantic UI's transitive dependencies, for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   Prioritize updating dependencies with critical vulnerabilities immediately.
        *   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automate vulnerability detection and management and receive alerts about vulnerable dependencies.

## Threat: [Using Outdated Semantic UI Version with Known Critical Vulnerabilities](./threats/using_outdated_semantic_ui_version_with_known_critical_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Failing to update Semantic UI to the latest version can leave the application directly vulnerable to publicly known, critical exploits that have been patched in newer releases of Semantic UI itself. Attackers can specifically target these vulnerabilities if the application is running an outdated version.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to critical security breaches, potentially allowing remote code execution, data breaches, or complete compromise of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The entire library, as critical vulnerabilities can exist in any part of it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust and automated process for regularly updating Semantic UI and its dependencies.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for Semantic UI to be informed about critical vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security vulnerability databases and promptly apply updates when critical issues are identified in the Semantic UI version your application is using.
