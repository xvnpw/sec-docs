# Attack Surface Analysis for semantic-org/semantic-ui

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Component Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_component_misconfiguration.md)

*Description:* Injection of malicious JavaScript code into the application through Semantic-UI components that handle user input or dynamically render content.
*How Semantic-UI Contributes:* Semantic-UI components often accept user-supplied data or parameters that, if not handled correctly, can be exploited to inject scripts. The framework's built-in sanitization is not sufficient on its own.
*Example:* A user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a Semantic-UI `input` field, which is then displayed without proper escaping in a `message` or `popup` component.  Or, a `dropdown` component renders options based on unsanitized data from an API.
*Impact:*
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing sensitive user data.
    *   Defacement.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Malware installation.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Server-Side Input Validation:** *Always* validate and sanitize all user input on the server-side. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode data appropriately when displaying it back to the user (HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding, etc.).
    *   **Client-Side Sanitization (Defense in Depth):** Use DOMPurify or a similar library *in addition to* server-side measures.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to restrict script sources. Avoid `unsafe-inline` and be cautious with `unsafe-eval`.
    *   **Component-Specific Configuration:** Carefully review Semantic-UI documentation for each component. Use `text` instead of `html` properties where appropriate.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Semantic-UI updated.

## Attack Surface: [Component-Specific Logic Flaws](./attack_surfaces/component-specific_logic_flaws.md)

*Description:* Exploiting vulnerabilities or unexpected behaviors within specific Semantic-UI components due to bugs in the framework's code.
*How Semantic-UI Contributes:* Semantic-UI, like any software, may contain undiscovered bugs in its component logic that could be exploited.
*Example:* A hypothetical flaw in the `modal` component's event handling that allows bypassing security checks, or a vulnerability in the `api` module allowing unintended API calls.
*Impact:* Varies depending on the flaw. Could range from minor issues to serious security breaches (e.g., bypassing authentication, unauthorized data access).
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Semantic-UI updated to the latest version. This is the *most crucial* mitigation.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability reports.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing, focusing on Semantic-UI components.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Perform thorough code reviews of application code interacting with Semantic-UI.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Consider using static analysis tools to scan the Semantic-UI codebase.

## Attack Surface: [Using Outdated Semantic-UI Version](./attack_surfaces/using_outdated_semantic-ui_version.md)

*Description:* Using an outdated version of the framework that contains known vulnerabilities.
*How Semantic-UI Contributes:* Older versions may have unpatched security flaws that have been addressed in later releases.
*Example:* Using a version of Semantic-UI with a known XSS vulnerability in the `dropdown` component that has been fixed in a subsequent release.
*Impact:* Exposes the application to known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to XSS, DoS, or other exploits.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (depending on the vulnerabilities present)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Semantic-UI updated to the latest stable version. Implement a process for regularly checking for and applying updates.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a package manager (npm, yarn) to manage Semantic-UI and other dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify outdated dependencies and known vulnerabilities.
