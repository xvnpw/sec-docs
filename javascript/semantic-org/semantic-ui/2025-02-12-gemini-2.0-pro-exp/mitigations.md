# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for semantic-org/semantic-ui

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fork and Maintain](./mitigation_strategies/fork_and_maintain.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Forking:** Create a private fork of the Semantic UI repository (or a well-maintained community fork like Fomantic UI). This is the most direct way to control the Semantic UI code itself.
2.  **Dependency Updates (within the fork):** Regularly update dependencies, *especially* jQuery, to their latest secure versions *within your forked repository*. This directly impacts the Semantic UI code you're using.
3.  **Vulnerability Patching (within the fork):** Monitor for vulnerabilities and apply patches directly to your forked Semantic UI codebase. This is a direct modification of the framework.
4.  **Code Auditing (of the fork):** Conduct security audits of the forked Semantic UI code, focusing on areas that handle user input or interact with external resources. This is a direct examination of the framework's code.
5. **Component Modification/Removal (within the fork):** If specific Semantic UI components are identified as problematic, modify or remove them directly within your forked repository.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unpatched Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in the core Semantic UI code.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Risk of malicious code in the Semantic UI repository.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via outdated components (Medium Severity):** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in older Semantic UI components.

**Impact:**
*   **Unpatched Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated with diligent patching).
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (you control the codebase).
*   **DoS via outdated components:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status)
*   Not Implemented.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Replace with your project's status)
*   Entire project. Requires forking the repository and establishing a maintenance process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management (Focus on jQuery *within* Semantic UI)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management__focus_on_jquery_within_semantic_ui_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify jQuery Version (used by Semantic UI):** Determine the exact version of jQuery that Semantic UI is configured to use. This might involve examining Semantic UI's source code or build configuration.
2.  **Pin to a Secure Version (within Semantic UI's configuration):** If possible, modify Semantic UI's configuration (e.g., build scripts, configuration files) to *force* it to use a specific, known-safe version of jQuery. This is a direct modification of how Semantic UI interacts with its dependency.  This is much easier if you have forked the repository.
3. **Update jQuery (within Semantic UI's build process):** If you've forked Semantic UI, modify the build process to use the updated jQuery version. This is a direct change to how Semantic UI is built.
4.  **Consider Removal (of jQuery from Semantic UI):**  This is the most direct, but also the most complex, approach.  It involves *rewriting parts of Semantic UI* to remove its reliance on jQuery. This is a significant modification of the framework's code.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **jQuery Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** XSS and other vulnerabilities in jQuery that could be exploited *through* Semantic UI.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (via jQuery) (High Severity):** Risk of malicious code in a compromised jQuery version used by Semantic UI.

**Impact:**
*   **jQuery Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced by controlling the jQuery version used *by* Semantic UI.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (via jQuery):** Risk reduced, especially if you control the build process of your forked version.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
*   Not Implemented. We are relying on the jQuery version bundled with the unmaintained Semantic UI.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   Requires modifying Semantic UI's configuration or build process (ideally within a forked repository) to control the jQuery version.  The "removal" option requires significant code changes to Semantic UI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Component-Specific Input Handling (Modifying Semantic UI Components)](./mitigation_strategies/component-specific_input_handling__modifying_semantic_ui_components_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify High-Risk Components:** Focus on Semantic UI components that handle user input.
2.  **Modify Component Code (within your fork):** Directly modify the JavaScript code of these Semantic UI components (within your forked repository) to:
    *   Add input sanitization *before* the component processes the input. This is a direct change to the component's logic.
    *   Improve or add client-side validation (understanding that server-side validation is still essential).
    *   Ensure proper output encoding within the component's rendering logic.
    *   Remove or disable any features that allow arbitrary HTML or script execution if they are not absolutely necessary.
3. **Avoid inline event handlers:** Avoid using inline event handlers like `onclick` within your Semantic UI components. Instead, use unobtrusive JavaScript to attach event listeners.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Injection of malicious scripts *through* specific Semantic UI components.
*   **Component-Specific Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Any vulnerabilities specific to how a particular Semantic UI component handles input.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Risk reduced by directly hardening the component's code against script injection.
*   **Component-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced by addressing vulnerabilities directly within the component.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
*   Not Implemented.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   Requires modifying the source code of individual Semantic UI components (ideally within a forked repository).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Denial of Service Mitigation for JavaScript Components (Modifying/Configuring Semantic UI)](./mitigation_strategies/denial_of_service_mitigation_for_javascript_components__modifyingconfiguring_semantic_ui_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Heavy Components:** Use browser developer tools to profile Semantic UI components.
2.  **Lazy Loading (Configuration/Modification):** Implement lazy loading for Semantic UI components. This might involve:
    *   Modifying the component's initialization logic (within your fork) to delay loading until it's needed.
    *   Using Semantic UI's configuration options (if available) to enable lazy loading for specific components.
3.  **Debouncing and Throttling (within Component Code):** Modify the JavaScript code of Semantic UI components (within your fork) to add debouncing and throttling to event handlers. This is a direct code change.
4.  **Component Optimization (within your fork):**
    *   Simplify the component's configuration (if possible, through Semantic UI's options).
    *   Modify the component's code (within your fork) to improve its performance.
    *   If a component is inherently heavy and cannot be optimized, consider *replacing it with a custom, lightweight alternative* (which is a direct change to how you *use* Semantic UI).
5. **Asynchronous Operations (within Component Code):** Modify the JavaScript code of Semantic UI components (within your fork) to perform long-running operations asynchronously.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Excessive use of JavaScript components leading to unresponsiveness.
*   **Poor User Experience (Low Severity):** Slow performance due to heavy component usage.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced by optimizing component usage and preventing excessive resource consumption *within* Semantic UI.
*   **Poor User Experience:** Improved responsiveness.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
*   Not Implemented.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   Requires modifying the initialization logic, event handlers, and potentially the core code of Semantic UI components (ideally within a forked repository).  Configuration changes might be possible if Semantic UI provides relevant options.
