# Threat Model Analysis for semantic-org/semantic-ui

## Threat: [Outdated Dropdown Component XSS](./threats/outdated_dropdown_component_xss.md)

*   **Threat:** Outdated Dropdown Component XSS

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of Semantic UI's `dropdown` module. The attacker crafts a malicious payload that is injected into the dropdown's options or data source. When a user interacts with the dropdown, the payload executes, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or modifying the page content. This is a *direct* threat because it leverages a vulnerability *within* the Semantic UI component itself, assuming the application uses user-provided data to populate dropdown.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dropdown` module (JavaScript and potentially associated CSS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Update to the latest stable version of Semantic UI.
        *   Sanitize and validate all data used to populate the dropdown, regardless of the source (even if it seems "safe"). Use a robust HTML sanitization library.
        *   Ensure that the dropdown's configuration does not allow arbitrary HTML content.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts.

## Threat: [Modal Component Content Injection](./threats/modal_component_content_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Modal Component Content Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability or misconfiguration in the `modal` component to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript. If the modal's content is dynamically generated from user input without proper sanitization, *and* the Semantic UI version used has a vulnerability allowing this, or if the modal is explicitly configured (incorrectly) to allow arbitrary HTML, an attacker can inject a script that executes when the modal is displayed. The *direct* threat here is the potential for a vulnerability *within* Semantic UI's modal handling, combined with improper application-level handling.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:** `modal` module (JavaScript and potentially associated CSS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all data used to populate the modal's content. Use a robust HTML sanitization library.
        *   Ensure that the modal's configuration does *not* allow arbitrary HTML content. Use the appropriate settings to display only plain text or pre-sanitized HTML.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts.
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly in the modal's title or other sensitive areas.
        *   Update to the latest stable version of Semantic UI.

## Threat: [Form Validation Bypass (Semantic UI's `form` module) - *Conditional High*](./threats/form_validation_bypass__semantic_ui's__form__module__-_conditional_high.md)

*   **Threat:** Form Validation Bypass (Semantic UI's `form` module) - *Conditional High*

    *   **Description:** An attacker bypasses Semantic UI's built-in form validation by manipulating the form data before it is submitted. The attacker might disable JavaScript, modify the form's HTML structure, or send a crafted request directly to the server.  This is *conditionally* high because it's *primarily* an application-level vulnerability (relying solely on client-side validation). However, if a specific version of Semantic UI's `form` module had a flaw that made bypass *easier* than normal client-side bypass, it would become a direct threat. We're including it as "High" with this caveat.
    *   **Impact:** Submission of invalid or malicious data, potentially leading to data corruption, SQL injection (if the backend doesn't validate), or other application-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `form` module (JavaScript).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Conditional - dependent on application's reliance on client-side validation *and* potential vulnerabilities in specific Semantic UI versions).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** rely solely on client-side validation (including Semantic UI's). Implement robust server-side validation for *all* form data.
        *   Treat Semantic UI's form validation as a usability feature, not a primary security control.
        *   Use server-side frameworks and libraries that provide built-in validation mechanisms.
        *   Consider using techniques like CSRF protection to prevent attackers from submitting forged requests.
        *   Update to the latest stable version of Semantic UI.
