## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: [1.2] Improper Input Sanitization (L: H, I: H, E: L, S: L, D: H)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path__1_2__improper_input_sanitization__l_h__i_h__e_l__s_l__d_h_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical vulnerability. It stems from the application failing to properly sanitize user-supplied data *before* it's used within Semantic-UI components.  This is a fundamental security flaw, independent of any specific Semantic-UI bug.
*   **Likelihood (High):**  This is a very common mistake in web development. Developers often underestimate the creativity of attackers in crafting malicious input, or they rely on insufficient sanitization methods.
*   **Impact (High):** Successful XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the user's session cookie and impersonating them.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page or stored in cookies/local storage.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Modifying the content of the page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Injecting malicious scripts that infect the user's computer.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting the user to a fake login page to steal credentials.
*   **Effort (Low):**  Exploiting this vulnerability is often trivial.  Basic XSS payloads are widely available, and attackers can easily test for input validation weaknesses.
*   **Skill Level (Low):**  Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is sufficient to craft simple XSS payloads. More sophisticated attacks might require more skill, but the entry barrier is low.
*   **Detection Difficulty (High):**  The vulnerability exists within the *application's* code, not within Semantic-UI itself.  Standard security scanners might not detect it if they don't thoroughly test all input fields and how the application handles user-provided data.  The attack can be stealthy, leaving no obvious traces in server logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [1.2.1] Dropdown (L: H, I: H, E: L, S: L, D: H)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__1_2_1__dropdown__l_h__i_h__e_l__s_l__d_h_.md)

*   **Description:**  Semantic-UI dropdowns are often populated with data from user input (e.g., search suggestions, form fields). If this data is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the dropdown options.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable code:
    $('.ui.dropdown').dropdown({
      values: [
        { name: '<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>', value: 'bad' } // Malicious input
      ]
    });
    ```
*   **Specifics:** The attacker might inject a payload like `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` or `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` into a field that populates the dropdown. When the dropdown is rendered, the browser will execute the malicious code.
*   **Ratings Justification:** Inherits the high likelihood, impact, low effort, and low skill level from the parent node (Improper Input Sanitization). Detection difficulty is also high for the same reasons.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [1.2.2] Popup (L: H, I: H, E: L, S: L, D: H)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__1_2_2__popup__l_h__i_h__e_l__s_l__d_h_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to dropdowns, Semantic-UI popups can display user-supplied content in their title or body.  If this content is not sanitized, it's vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable code:
    $('.someElement').popup({
      title: '<script>alert("XSS")</script>', // Malicious input in title
      content: 'Some static content'
    });
    ```
*   **Specifics:** Attackers can inject malicious code into the `title` or `content` properties of the popup. This code will be executed when the popup is displayed.
*   **Ratings Justification:**  Identical to the Dropdown vulnerability (1.2.1) in terms of likelihood, impact, effort, skill, and detection difficulty.
