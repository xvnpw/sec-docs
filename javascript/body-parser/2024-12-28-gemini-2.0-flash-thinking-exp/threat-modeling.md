*   **Threat:** JSON Bomb/Recursive Payload
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload with deeply nested objects or arrays. This forces the `bodyParser.json()` module to perform excessive processing and memory allocation while trying to parse the complex structure. The attacker might repeatedly send such payloads to exhaust server resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the server becomes unresponsive or crashes due to high CPU and memory usage. This prevents legitimate users from accessing the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `bodyParser.json()` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the `limit` option in `bodyParser.json()` to restrict the maximum size of the request body.
        *   Consider using a JSON parsing library with built-in protection against recursive structures or implement custom checks to limit nesting depth.

*   **Threat:** Large Request Body (All Types)
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends an excessively large request body, regardless of the content type (JSON, URL-encoded, raw, text). This forces the corresponding `bodyParser` middleware to allocate a significant amount of memory to store the data. Repeatedly sending such large requests can lead to memory exhaustion and a DoS.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:** All `bodyParser` middleware (`bodyParser.json()`, `bodyParser.urlencoded()`, `bodyParser.raw()`, `bodyParser.text()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always configure the `limit` option for all relevant `bodyParser` middleware to enforce maximum request body sizes. This is a crucial security measure.

*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration - Missing `limit` Option
    *   **Description:** Developers fail to configure the `limit` option in `bodyParser` middleware. This leaves the application vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks via large request bodies, as there is no restriction on the size of data being processed.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration of all `bodyParser` middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always explicitly configure the `limit` option for all relevant `bodyParser` middleware based on the expected size of request bodies for your application.
