# Deep Analysis: GLSL Injection Attack Surface in Three.js Applications

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which GLSL injection attacks can occur within a Three.js application.
*   Identify specific code patterns and practices within Three.js that increase vulnerability to this attack.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations to developers to mitigate the risk of GLSL injection.
*   Establish clear guidelines for secure shader handling within the application.
*   Raise awareness of the severity and potential impact of successful GLSL injection.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the **GLSL injection attack surface** within applications built using the Three.js library.  It covers:

*   **Direct GLSL code injection:**  Scenarios where user input is directly incorporated into shader source code.
*   **Indirect GLSL code manipulation:**  Situations where user input influences shader behavior in unintended ways, even if not directly injected.
*   **Three.js-specific vulnerabilities:**  How the design and features of Three.js might contribute to or exacerbate the risk.
*   **Client-side impact:**  The analysis primarily focuses on the client-side consequences of GLSL injection (browser, GPU).  While server-side implications might exist (e.g., if shader code is generated server-side), they are secondary to this analysis.
* **WebGL API:** How WebGL API is used by Three.js and how it can be misused.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General web application security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) *unless* they directly relate to GLSL injection.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying WebGL implementation or graphics drivers (although the impact of such vulnerabilities is considered).
*   Attacks targeting other parts of the application stack (e.g., network, database) that are unrelated to Three.js and shaders.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attack vectors and scenarios based on how Three.js handles shaders and user input.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical & Example):**  Analyze common Three.js code patterns and identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will include both hypothetical examples and, if available, real-world code snippets (anonymized and generalized).
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Deep dive into the specific mechanisms of GLSL injection, including how Three.js compiles and uses shaders.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detail the potential consequences of successful attacks, including denial of service, information disclosure, and other risks.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to prevent and mitigate GLSL injection vulnerabilities.  This will include best practices, code examples, and security guidelines.
6.  **Documentation and Communication:**  Clearly document the findings and recommendations in a format accessible to developers.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1 Threat Modeling

**Attackers:**

*   **Malicious users:**  Individuals intentionally attempting to exploit the application.
*   **Compromised accounts:**  Legitimate user accounts that have been taken over by attackers.
*   **XSS attackers:**  Attackers who have already compromised the application through other means (e.g., XSS) and are now attempting to escalate their privileges or cause further damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Input Fields:**  Forms or UI elements that allow users to directly input GLSL code or parameters that are directly concatenated into shader source.
*   **Indirect Input (Data-Driven Shaders):**  Features that allow users to customize visual effects (e.g., colors, textures, material properties) through seemingly safe inputs, which are then used to construct or modify shader code.
*   **Uploaded Files:**  Allowing users to upload files (e.g., textures, models) that contain embedded malicious shader code or influence shader generation.
*   **API Endpoints:**  API calls that accept parameters used in shader compilation or modification.
*   **Third-Party Libraries/Plugins:**  Vulnerabilities in external libraries or plugins that interact with Three.js's shader system.
*   **URL Parameters:** Using URL parameters to control shader behavior, making it susceptible to manipulation.

**Attack Scenarios:**

1.  **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker provides GLSL code that causes an infinite loop, excessive resource consumption, or a shader compilation error, crashing the browser tab or the entire browser.
2.  **Information Disclosure (Pixel Reading):**  An attacker crafts a shader that reads pixel data from arbitrary locations on the screen, potentially including data from other origins (violating the Same-Origin Policy).  This could leak sensitive information displayed in other tabs or windows.
3.  **GPU Fingerprinting:**  An attacker uses subtle variations in shader execution to identify the user's GPU, creating a unique fingerprint for tracking purposes.
4.  **Arbitrary Code Execution (Rare):**  While less likely, vulnerabilities in the browser's WebGL implementation or the graphics driver could potentially be exploited through malicious GLSL code to achieve arbitrary code execution. This is a *very* high-severity, low-probability scenario.

### 2.2 Code Review (Hypothetical & Example)

**2.2.1 Vulnerable Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Direct Injection (Extreme Risk)**

```javascript
// TERRIBLE, DO NOT USE!  VULNERABLE!
function createCustomMaterial(userShaderCode) {
  const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
    vertexShader: `
      void main() {
        gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
      }
    `,
    fragmentShader: `
      void main() {
        ${userShaderCode} // DIRECT INJECTION!
      }
    `
  });
  return material;
}

// Attacker input:
const maliciousCode = `
  gl_FragColor = texture2D(maliciousTexture, vec2(0.5, 0.5)); // Read from arbitrary texture
  // Or:  while(true) {}  // Infinite loop
`;

const badMaterial = createCustomMaterial(maliciousCode);
scene.add(new THREE.Mesh(geometry, badMaterial));
```

This is the most obvious and dangerous vulnerability.  User-provided code is directly inserted into the fragment shader.

**Example 2: Indirect Injection via String Concatenation (High Risk)**

```javascript
// BAD, DO NOT USE! VULNERABLE!
function createColoredMaterial(userColor) {
  const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
    vertexShader: `...`,
    fragmentShader: `
      void main() {
        gl_FragColor = vec4(${userColor}, 1.0); // INDIRECT INJECTION!
      }
    `
  });
  return material;
}

// Attacker input:  "0.0, 0.0, 0.0);  // Malicious code here "
// Resulting shader:  gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);  // Malicious code here , 1.0);
```

Even seemingly safe parameters like colors can be exploited if they are directly concatenated into the shader string.  The attacker can inject arbitrary code by closing the `vec4` constructor and adding their own code.

**Example 3:  Misuse of `onBeforeCompile` (Medium Risk)**

```javascript
// POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE, REQUIRES CAREFUL REVIEW
material.onBeforeCompile = (shader) => {
  shader.fragmentShader = shader.fragmentShader.replace(
    '#include <common>',
    '#include <common>\n' + userProvidedCode // DANGEROUS!
  );
};
```

The `onBeforeCompile` callback allows modification of the shader *before* compilation.  While powerful, it's extremely dangerous if used with user input.  Even seemingly safe replacements can be exploited.

**2.2.2 Safe Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using Uniforms (Safe)**

```javascript
// SAFE - Uses uniforms for parameterization
function createColoredMaterial(userColor) {
  const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
    uniforms: {
      userColor: { value: new THREE.Color(userColor) } // Use THREE.Color
    },
    vertexShader: `...`,
    fragmentShader: `
      uniform vec3 userColor;
      void main() {
        gl_FragColor = vec4(userColor, 1.0);
      }
    `
  });
  return material;
}

// Usage:
const safeMaterial = createColoredMaterial("#ff0000"); // Pass a valid color string
// Or, to update the color:
safeMaterial.uniforms.userColor.value.set("#00ff00");
```

This is the recommended approach.  Data is passed to the shader via a *uniform*, which is a well-defined, typed interface.  Three.js handles the safe transfer of this data to the GPU.

**Example 2:  Pre-compiled Shaders with Uniforms (Safe)**

```javascript
// SAFE - Pre-compiled shader with uniforms
const vertexShader = `...`; // Define shader code separately
const fragmentShader = `
  uniform vec3 userColor;
  void main() {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(userColor, 1.0);
  }
`;

const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    userColor: { value: new THREE.Color(0xff0000) }
  },
  vertexShader: vertexShader,
  fragmentShader: fragmentShader
});

// Usage:
// Update the color:
material.uniforms.userColor.value.set("#00ff00");
```

This approach avoids any dynamic shader compilation at runtime, further reducing the attack surface.

### 2.3 Vulnerability Analysis

**2.3.1 Three.js Shader Compilation Process:**

1.  **Shader Source Code:**  The developer provides GLSL source code, either directly as strings or by referencing built-in Three.js shaders.
2.  **`onBeforeCompile` (Optional):**  If defined, this callback is executed, allowing modification of the shader source code *before* compilation. This is a critical point for potential injection.
3.  **WebGL API Calls:**  Three.js uses the WebGL API (`gl.createShader`, `gl.shaderSource`, `gl.compileShader`, `gl.attachShader`, `gl.linkProgram`, etc.) to compile and link the shaders.
4.  **GPU Execution:**  The compiled shader program is uploaded to the GPU and executed for each rendered frame.

**2.3.2 Injection Mechanisms:**

*   **Direct Code Insertion:**  The most direct method, where user input is directly placed into the GLSL source code string.
*   **String Manipulation:**  Exploiting string concatenation or replacement operations to inject malicious code.  This often involves breaking out of intended string literals or function calls within the shader.
*   **Type Confusion:**  Exploiting weaknesses in how Three.js handles different data types when constructing shaders.  For example, passing a string where a number is expected, and that string contains malicious code.
*   **WebGL API Misuse:** While less direct, an attacker could potentially influence the parameters passed to WebGL API calls (e.g., `gl.shaderSource`) if those parameters are derived from user input.

### 2.4 Impact Assessment

| Impact                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Severity |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Denial of Service (DoS)    | The attacker can crash the user's browser tab, the entire browser, or even the user's GPU, rendering the application unusable.  This can be achieved through infinite loops, excessive memory allocation, or triggering shader compilation errors.                     | High     |
| Information Disclosure     | The attacker can read pixel data from the screen, potentially accessing sensitive information displayed in other parts of the application or even in other browser tabs/windows (cross-origin data leakage). This is a serious privacy and security violation. | Critical |
| GPU Fingerprinting         | The attacker can use subtle differences in shader execution to identify the user's GPU, creating a unique fingerprint for tracking and potentially deanonymization.                                                                                                   | Medium   |
| Arbitrary Code Execution   | In rare cases, vulnerabilities in the browser's WebGL implementation or the graphics driver could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This is a highly unlikely but extremely severe outcome.                                   | Critical |
| Client-Side Manipulation | The attacker can alter the visual appearance of the application, potentially displaying misleading information, defacing the website, or creating phishing attacks.                                                                                                 | Medium   |

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Never Directly Embed User Input:**  The most crucial rule.  User input should *never* be directly concatenated or interpolated into shader source code strings.

2.  **Use Uniforms Exclusively:**  Uniforms are the *only* safe way to pass data to shaders.  Treat them as the sole communication channel between JavaScript and GLSL.

3.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**

    *   **Whitelisting:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed values for all user inputs that influence shader behavior.  Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Type Checking:**  Ensure that user input is of the correct data type (e.g., number, color, vector) before passing it to a uniform.  Use Three.js's built-in types (e.g., `THREE.Color`, `THREE.Vector3`) whenever possible.
    *   **Range Checking:**  For numerical inputs, enforce minimum and maximum values to prevent out-of-bounds values that could cause unexpected behavior.
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  Use regular expressions to validate the format of string inputs (e.g., color codes).
    *   **Sanitization:**  Even with whitelisting, consider sanitizing inputs to remove any potentially harmful characters or sequences. However, be extremely cautious with sanitization, as it can be easily bypassed if not implemented correctly. Focus on whitelisting and type checking as the primary defense.

4.  **Avoid Dynamic Shader Compilation:**

    *   **Pre-compile Shaders:**  Define shader code as static strings or in separate files.  Avoid constructing shaders dynamically based on user input.
    *   **Shader Library:**  Create a library of pre-defined shaders that can be selected based on user preferences, rather than allowing users to create their own shaders.

5.  **Shader Parameterization:**

    *   **Design for Uniforms:**  Design shaders to accept parameters (uniforms) rather than constructing them dynamically.  This limits the attacker's ability to inject arbitrary code.
    *   **Limited Functionality:**  If users need to customize visual effects, provide a limited set of options that can be controlled through uniforms, rather than allowing full shader customization.

6.  **Careful Use of `onBeforeCompile`:**

    *   **Avoid User Input:**  Do not use user input within the `onBeforeCompile` callback unless absolutely necessary, and then only with extreme caution and rigorous validation.
    *   **Constant Replacements:**  If you must use `onBeforeCompile`, restrict it to replacing constant values or pre-defined code snippets, never user-provided data.

7.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**

    *   **`script-src`:**  While CSP primarily protects against XSS, a properly configured `script-src` directive can help prevent the injection of malicious JavaScript that could then be used to manipulate shaders.
    *   **`unsafe-eval`:** Avoid using `'unsafe-eval'` in your CSP, as it can enable certain types of injection attacks.

8.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

9.  **Stay Updated:**  Keep Three.js and all related libraries up to date to benefit from security patches and improvements.

10. **Educate Developers:** Ensure all developers working with Three.js are aware of the risks of GLSL injection and the mitigation strategies.

## 3. Conclusion

GLSL injection is a critical vulnerability in Three.js applications that can lead to severe consequences, including denial of service, information disclosure, and potentially even arbitrary code execution. By understanding the attack vectors, implementing strict input validation, and using uniforms exclusively for shader parameterization, developers can effectively mitigate this risk and build secure and robust WebGL applications. The key takeaway is to treat all user input as potentially malicious and to avoid any direct or indirect incorporation of user data into shader source code.
