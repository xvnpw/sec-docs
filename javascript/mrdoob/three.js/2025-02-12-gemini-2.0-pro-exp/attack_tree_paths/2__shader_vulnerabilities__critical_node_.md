# Deep Analysis: GLSL Injection in Three.js Applications

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the risk of GLSL injection vulnerabilities (both fragment and vertex shader) within a Three.js application, identify potential attack vectors, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The goal is to provide actionable guidance to the development team to prevent this critical vulnerability.

**Scope:** This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   Three.js applications that utilize custom shaders (written in GLSL).
*   Scenarios where user-provided input, directly or indirectly, influences the generation or modification of shader code or shader uniform variables.
*   Both fragment and vertex shader injection vulnerabilities.
*   The browser environment as the primary target of the attack.
*   The analysis will *not* cover vulnerabilities in the Three.js library itself, but rather how the library is *used* by the application.  We assume the Three.js library is up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific scenarios within the application where user input might influence shader code or uniforms.  This includes analyzing data flow from user input to shader execution.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine the identified scenarios for potential injection points and weaknesses in input validation or sanitization.
3.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Construct hypothetical exploit scenarios to demonstrate the potential impact of successful GLSL injection.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Provide detailed, practical, and prioritized mitigation recommendations, including code examples and best practices.
5.  **Tooling and Testing Recommendations:** Suggest tools and techniques for detecting and preventing GLSL injection vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Shader Vulnerabilities

### 2.1 Threat Modeling: Identifying Potential Attack Vectors

We need to identify how user input could reach the shader code.  Here are some common scenarios in Three.js applications:

*   **Customizable Materials:**  The application allows users to customize the appearance of objects by adjusting material properties (e.g., color, texture, shininess).  These properties are often passed as uniform variables to shaders.
*   **Interactive Effects:**  User interaction (e.g., mouse movements, clicks, keyboard input) triggers changes in shader parameters, creating dynamic visual effects.
*   **Data Visualization:**  The application visualizes user-provided data (e.g., from a file upload, form input, or API call) using shaders.  The data might directly influence shader calculations or be used to select different shader programs.
*   **Post-Processing Effects:**  Users can select or configure post-processing effects (e.g., blur, bloom, distortion) that are implemented using custom shaders.
*   **URL Parameters:**  Shader parameters or even shader code snippets might be passed through URL parameters, allowing for externally controlled attacks.
* **Imported Models:** If the application allows users to import 3D models in formats that can contain embedded shaders (less common, but possible), this could be a vector.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis: Injection Points and Weaknesses

The core vulnerability lies in *insufficiently validated or sanitized user input* that is used to construct or modify shader code or uniform variables.  Here are specific weaknesses:

*   **Direct String Concatenation:**  The most dangerous scenario is directly concatenating user input into the shader source code.  This is a classic injection vulnerability.
    ```javascript
    // EXTREMELY VULNERABLE - DO NOT DO THIS!
    let userInput = document.getElementById("colorInput").value; // e.g., "red; //"
    let shaderSource = `
        void main() {
            gl_FragColor = vec4(${userInput}, 1.0);
        }
    `;
    ```
    In this example, a malicious user could input something like `0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);  // Do something malicious here`, effectively injecting arbitrary GLSL code.

*   **Insufficiently Strict Uniform Validation:**  Even when using uniform variables, weak validation can lead to vulnerabilities.  For example:
    *   **Type Mismatch:**  If a uniform is expected to be a `float`, but the application doesn't enforce this, a malicious user might provide a string that, when interpreted as a float, causes unexpected behavior or crashes the GPU.
    *   **Range Violations:**  If a uniform represents a color component (0.0 to 1.0), but the application doesn't check for values outside this range, it could lead to rendering artifacts or potentially exploitable behavior.
    *   **Semantic Misinterpretation:**  Even if the type and range are correct, the *meaning* of the input might be misinterpreted.  For example, a uniform controlling a texture offset might be manipulated to access unintended memory regions.

*   **Indirect Injection:**  User input might not directly appear in the shader code but could still influence it indirectly.  For example:
    *   **Conditional Shader Compilation:**  User input might be used to select different shader code branches using `#ifdef` preprocessor directives.  A malicious user could trigger the compilation of a vulnerable code path.
    *   **Shader Program Selection:**  User input might determine which shader program is used.  A malicious user could force the application to use a pre-existing, vulnerable shader.

### 2.3 Exploit Scenario Development

**Scenario:**  A Three.js application allows users to customize the color of a 3D model.  The color is passed as a `vec3` uniform to the fragment shader.  The application validates that the input is a string, but it doesn't check the format or content of the string.

**Exploit:**

1.  **Attacker Input:** The attacker provides the following input for the color: `0.0, 0.0, 0.0);  float f = texture2D(sampler, vec2(0.5, 0.5)).r;  gl_FragColor = vec4(f, f, f, 1.0); //`
2.  **Shader Code:** The application constructs the following (simplified) shader code:
    ```glsl
    uniform vec3 userColor;
    void main() {
        gl_FragColor = vec4(userColor, 1.0);
    }
    ```
3.  **Injection:**  The attacker's input is directly inserted into the `userColor` uniform.  Because the application doesn't properly sanitize the input, the semicolon and subsequent code are injected into the shader.  The resulting shader executed on the GPU is effectively:
    ```glsl
    uniform vec3 userColor; // This uniform is ignored
    void main() {
        gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);  float f = texture2D(sampler, vec2(0.5, 0.5)).r;  gl_FragColor = vec4(f, f, f, 1.0); //, 1.0);
    }
    ```
4.  **Impact:** The injected code reads a pixel value from a texture (potentially a system texture or a texture containing sensitive data) and uses it to set the fragment color.  This is a simple example, but it demonstrates the principle.  A more sophisticated attacker could:
    *   **Read arbitrary memory:**  By manipulating texture coordinates, the attacker could potentially read from arbitrary GPU memory locations.
    *   **Perform calculations:**  The attacker could use the shader to perform arbitrary calculations, potentially leaking information through timing attacks or side channels.
    *   **Crash the GPU:**  The attacker could cause a GPU crash, leading to a denial-of-service.
    *   **Trigger WebGL vulnerabilities:**  The attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the WebGL implementation itself, potentially leading to browser compromise.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy Refinement

The following mitigation strategies are crucial, and should be implemented in order of priority:

1.  **Never Construct Shaders from User Input:**  This is the most important rule.  Shader code should be static and pre-defined.  User input should *only* be passed as uniform variables.

2.  **Strict Uniform Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Type Enforcement:**  Ensure that uniform variables are of the correct type (e.g., `float`, `vec3`, `mat4`).  Use Three.js's built-in uniform types and validation mechanisms.
        ```javascript
        // Good: Using Three.js uniform types
        material.uniforms.userColor = { value: new THREE.Color(0xff0000) }; // Enforces Color type

        // Also good, with explicit type checking:
        let userInput = parseFloat(document.getElementById("colorInput").value);
        if (isNaN(userInput) || userInput < 0.0 || userInput > 1.0) {
            // Handle invalid input (e.g., display an error message)
            userInput = 0.0; // Default value
        }
        material.uniforms.myFloatUniform = { value: userInput, type: 'f' }; // 'f' for float
        ```
    *   **Range Checking:**  Validate that uniform values are within the expected range.
        ```javascript
        let intensity = parseFloat(document.getElementById("intensityInput").value);
        intensity = Math.max(0.0, Math.min(1.0, intensity)); // Clamp to [0, 1]
        material.uniforms.intensity = { value: intensity };
        ```
    *   **Format Validation:**  If the uniform represents a specific format (e.g., a hexadecimal color code), validate the format using regular expressions or other appropriate methods.
        ```javascript
        let hexColor = document.getElementById("colorInput").value;
        if (/^#[0-9A-F]{6}$/i.test(hexColor)) {
            material.uniforms.userColor = { value: new THREE.Color(hexColor) };
        } else {
            // Handle invalid input
        }
        ```
    *   **Sanitization:**  Even with type and range checking, consider sanitizing string inputs to remove potentially harmful characters (e.g., semicolons, quotes).  However, *rely primarily on type and range checking*, as sanitization can be brittle.

3.  **Use Parameterized Shaders:**  Design your shaders to accept all user-configurable parameters as uniform variables.  Avoid using preprocessor directives (`#ifdef`) based on user input.

4.  **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review all shader code and the JavaScript code that interacts with it.  Look for any potential injection points or weaknesses in input validation.  A second pair of eyes is crucial.

5.  **Shader Sandboxing (Difficult, but Consider):**  True shader sandboxing in a browser environment is extremely challenging.  WebGL itself provides some level of isolation, but it's not a complete sandbox.  Researching and exploring potential future browser features or WebAssembly-based solutions for shader sandboxing could be beneficial in the long term, but is not a practical solution today.

### 2.5 Tooling and Testing Recommendations

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**  While there aren't many tools specifically designed for GLSL injection detection in a web context, general-purpose static analysis tools can help identify potential vulnerabilities in your JavaScript code (e.g., ESLint with security-focused plugins).
*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:**  Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to inspect the generated shader code and uniform values at runtime.  This can help you identify if any unexpected code is being injected.
*   **Fuzzing:**  Consider using fuzzing techniques to test your application with a wide range of unexpected inputs.  This can help uncover edge cases and vulnerabilities that might not be apparent during manual testing.  A simple fuzzer could generate random strings, numbers, and special characters and feed them into your application's input fields.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage a security professional to perform penetration testing on your application.  They can use specialized tools and techniques to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including GLSL injection.
* **WebGL Inspector:** Tools like Spector.js (https://github.com/BabylonJS/Spector.js) can be used to inspect WebGL calls, including shader compilation and uniform updates. This can help in debugging and identifying unexpected shader behavior.
