## Attack Tree Path: [1. Loader Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__loader_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Three.js relies on loaders (e.g., `GLTFLoader`, `OBJLoader`) to handle various 3D model formats.  These loaders parse complex data structures, making them potential targets for exploitation.
*   **1a. Malicious Model Loading (CWE-73) (Critical Node):**
    *   **Likelihood:** High.  Users often load models from external sources, and crafting malicious models is a well-known attack vector.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution, giving the attacker full control over the client-side application.
    *   **Effort:** Medium. Requires knowledge of 3D model formats and potential vulnerabilities in the specific loader being used.  Pre-made exploits or tools might be available.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.  Requires understanding of 3D model formats, parsing vulnerabilities, and potentially JavaScript exploitation techniques.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Malicious code might be obfuscated within the model file.  Requires careful inspection of loaded models and monitoring for unusual behavior.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate all model URLs and file contents before loading.  Reject models from untrusted sources.
        *   **Sandboxing:** If possible, load models in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Web Worker) to limit the impact of any potential exploits.
        *   **Use a Secure Parser:** Consider using a separate, security-focused library to pre-parse and validate models before passing them to Three.js.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict the origins from which models can be loaded.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Three.js and its loaders updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Shader Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__shader_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Shaders (written in GLSL) are programs that run on the GPU to control rendering.  They offer significant power but also introduce a large attack surface.
    *   **2a. GLSL Injection (Fragment Shader) (Critical Node):**
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if user input influences shader code).  Even seemingly innocuous inputs like color values can be manipulated.
        *   **Impact:** High.  Allows arbitrary code execution within the GPU context, potentially leading to complete browser compromise.
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High. Requires understanding of GLSL and how the application uses user input to generate shaders.
        *   **Skill Level:** High.  Requires expertise in shader programming and WebGL security.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High.  Malicious GLSL code can be subtle and difficult to detect without careful analysis.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Avoid Direct Input:**  *Never* construct shader code directly from user input.
            *   **Use Parameterized Shaders:**  Pass user input as uniform variables, which are treated as data, not code.
            *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize all uniform variable values.
            *   **Shader Sandboxing (if possible):**  Explore techniques for sandboxing shader execution (though this is challenging).
            *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review all shader code for potential injection vulnerabilities.

    *   **2b. GLSL Injection (Vertex Shader) (Critical Node):**
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if user input influences shader code). Similar to fragment shader injection.
        *   **Impact:** High.  Similar to fragment shader injection.
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High. Similar to fragment shader injection.
        *   **Skill Level:** High. Similar to fragment shader injection.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High. Similar to fragment shader injection.
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as for fragment shader injection (2a).

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/5__resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can attempt to crash the application or the user's browser by consuming excessive resources.
    *   **5a. Geometry Allocation (DoS):**
        *   **Likelihood:** High.  Relatively easy to create models with extremely high polygon counts.
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High.  Can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash, leading to denial of service.
        *   **Effort:** Low.  Can be achieved with readily available tools or by modifying existing models.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low.  Basic understanding of 3D models is sufficient.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Requires monitoring resource usage and identifying unusually large models.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Limit Model Complexity:**  Set limits on the number of polygons, vertices, and file size of uploaded models.
            *   **Server-Side Validation:**  Validate model complexity on the server before processing.
            *   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the rate at which users can upload or load models.

    *   **5b. Texture Allocation (DoS):**
        *   **Likelihood:** High.  Similar to geometry allocation, large textures can consume significant memory.
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High.  Can lead to application crashes or unresponsiveness.
        *   **Effort:** Low.  Large image files are readily available.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Requires monitoring memory usage and identifying unusually large textures.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Limit Texture Size:**  Set maximum dimensions and file sizes for textures.
            *   **Server-Side Validation:**  Validate texture dimensions and file sizes on the server.
            *   **Use Compressed Textures:**  Encourage or require the use of compressed texture formats (e.g., DDS, KTX).
            *   **Progressive Loading:**  Load textures progressively to avoid sudden spikes in memory usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Misconfigured Features](./attack_tree_paths/6__misconfigured_features.md)

* **6e. Improper Loading Logic (HIGH RISK):**
    *   **Likelihood:** High. This is a common area for errors, especially in complex applications.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Depends on the specific vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium. Depends on the complexity of the loading logic and the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of web security principles and how Three.js handles resource loading.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High. Requires careful code review and potentially dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Validate URLs:** Ensure that all URLs used for loading resources are valid and point to trusted sources.
        *   **Sanitize Data:** Sanitize all data loaded from external sources, even if they are considered trusted.
        *   **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Implement robust error handling to prevent information leakage and unexpected behavior.
        *   **Avoid Race Conditions:** Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms when loading multiple resources asynchronously.
        *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to general web security best practices, such as the principle of least privilege.
