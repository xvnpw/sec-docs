# Attack Surface Analysis for mrdoob/three.js

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted 3D Models](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_3d_models.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in three.js model loaders (e.g., GLTFLoader, OBJLoader, FBXLoader) by providing specially crafted model files.
    *   **How three.js contributes:** three.js provides the parsing and loading mechanisms for various 3D model formats. Vulnerabilities in these loaders can be directly exploited.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted GLTF file that triggers a buffer overflow in the GLTFLoader, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution within the browser context.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the browser context, memory corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation: Validate model files before loading (e.g., check file size, basic structure if possible).
        *   Regular Updates: Keep three.js library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in loaders.
        *   Sandboxing/Isolation: If possible, process model files in an isolated environment before loading them into the main application.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong CSP to limit the capabilities of any potentially injected scripts.

## Attack Surface: [User-Provided Data Injection into Scene](./attack_surfaces/user-provided_data_injection_into_scene.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious data through user input that directly influences the three.js scene (e.g., coordinates, colors, text for 3D text).
    *   **How three.js contributes:** three.js renders the scene based on the data provided. If user input is not properly sanitized, it can lead to unexpected or harmful results.
    *   **Example:** A user providing malicious HTML or JavaScript code as input for `THREE.TextGeometry`, which could then be rendered and potentially executed in the browser context (leading to XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), unexpected visual distortions, application errors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Sanitization: Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided data before using it to generate the three.js scene. Escape HTML characters and other potentially harmful input.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP to prevent the execution of unintended scripts.
        *   Contextual Encoding: Encode user input appropriately for the context in which it's being used within three.js.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Loading of three.js or Assets](./attack_surfaces/insecure_loading_of_three_js_or_assets.md)

*   **Description:** Loading the three.js library or related assets (models, textures) over insecure HTTP connections.
    *   **How three.js contributes:**  The application relies on these external resources. If loaded over HTTP, they are susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the loading of the `three.js` library over HTTP and injects malicious code into the downloaded file, compromising the entire application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data compromise, complete application takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always Use HTTPS: Ensure that three.js and all related assets are loaded over secure HTTPS connections.
        *   Subresource Integrity (SRI): Implement SRI tags for three.js and other critical assets to ensure that the loaded files haven't been tampered with.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in three.js Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_three_js_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  three.js relies on other JavaScript libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect the security of the application.
    *   **How three.js contributes:** By depending on these libraries, three.js inherits any vulnerabilities present in them.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a math library used by three.js could be exploited through specific three.js functionalities that utilize that library.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to RCE, DoS, or data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regular Updates: Keep three.js and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Dependency Scanning: Use tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Careful Dependency Selection: Be mindful of the dependencies used by three.js and evaluate their security posture.
