## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_loading_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks that target the process of loading 3D models and other assets into the three.js scene. Attackers aim to leverage weaknesses in how the application handles external data sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious 3D Asset (Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_3d_asset__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker's goal is to provide a harmful 3D model to the application. This can be achieved through various means.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Model (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_model__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker uploads a specially crafted 3D model file. This model could contain embedded malicious scripts that execute when the model is parsed or rendered, exploit vulnerabilities in the model parsing library (e.g., glTF, OBJ loaders), or be designed to cause resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious URL for Model Loading (Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_url_for_model_loading__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker provides a URL pointing to a malicious 3D model hosted on an external server. If the application directly uses this URL to load the model without proper validation, it can be tricked into loading and processing the malicious content, similar to the "Upload Malicious Model" scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit User Interaction Vulnerabilities within the Three.js Context (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_user_interaction_vulnerabilities_within_the_three_js_context__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on attacks that leverage user interactions with the three.js scene to inject malicious content or manipulate the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Controlled Scene Data (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-controlled_scene_data__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

This is a classic web security vulnerability applied within the context of a three.js application. If user-provided data is directly incorporated into the three.js scene (e.g., as object names, labels, or custom attributes) without proper sanitization or encoding, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code. This code will then execute in the victim's browser when the scene is rendered, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code through Object Names/Labels (Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_through_object_nameslabels__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into fields like object names or labels that are later rendered or processed by the three.js application. When the application displays or interacts with these elements, the injected script executes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies or Extensions of Three.js (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_or_extensions_of_three_js__critical_node_.md)

Modern web applications, including those using three.js, often rely on external libraries and plugins. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Loaded Modules/Plugins (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_loaded_modulesplugins__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers target known security flaws in the third-party libraries or plugins used by the three.js application. These vulnerabilities can range from simple bugs to critical security holes that allow for remote code execution or other severe compromises. Attackers often leverage publicly available exploit code for these vulnerabilities.
