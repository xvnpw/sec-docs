## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Supply Malicious 3D Asset

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Supply Malicious 3D Asset" attack tree path within the context of an application utilizing the three.js library (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). This path is considered high-risk due to the potential for significant impact on the application's functionality, security, and user experience.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with an attacker successfully supplying a malicious 3D asset to the application. This includes:

* **Identifying potential attack vectors:** How can an attacker introduce a malicious asset?
* **Analyzing the potential impact:** What harm can a malicious asset inflict on the application and its users?
* **Identifying underlying vulnerabilities:** What weaknesses in the application or its environment could be exploited?
* **Developing mitigation strategies:** How can the development team prevent or mitigate these attacks?

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path where a malicious 3D asset is introduced into the application. The scope includes:

* **The process of loading and parsing 3D assets within the three.js application.** This includes various loader types (e.g., GLTFLoader, OBJLoader, FBXLoader).
* **Potential sources of 3D assets:** User uploads, external APIs, developer-included assets.
* **The potential for malicious content within the 3D asset file itself.**
* **The interaction of the loaded 3D asset with the three.js rendering engine and application logic.**

The scope excludes:

* **Network infrastructure vulnerabilities** (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks during asset transfer, unless directly related to asset integrity).
* **Authentication and authorization vulnerabilities** (unless directly related to controlling who can supply assets).
* **General web application vulnerabilities** not directly related to 3D asset handling (e.g., XSS outside of the context of 3D assets).

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Supply Malicious 3D Asset

**Attack Tree Path:** Supply Malicious 3D Asset (Part of High-Risk Path)

**Attacker Goal:** Provide a harmful 3D model to the application.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors and Potential Exploits:**

This high-level goal can be achieved through various sub-paths, each with its own set of potential exploits:

**4.1. User Upload of Malicious Asset:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted 3D model file through an application feature that allows user-provided assets.
* **Potential Exploits:**
    * **Malicious Code Execution:** The 3D model file (e.g., GLTF with embedded JavaScript extensions, or a format with inherent scripting capabilities if supported by the loader) contains malicious code that executes when the model is loaded or rendered. Three.js itself doesn't directly execute arbitrary code within model files, but vulnerabilities in custom loaders or extensions could be exploited.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** The model contains excessively complex geometry, textures, or animations that overwhelm the browser's rendering capabilities, causing the application to freeze or crash. This could be achieved through:
        * **Extremely high polygon counts.**
        * **Massive texture sizes.**
        * **Complex shader code (if custom shaders are allowed).**
        * **Infinite loops or resource-intensive operations within animation data.**
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  While less direct, a malicious model could potentially be designed to trigger requests to external servers controlled by the attacker, leaking information about the user or the application's environment. This is less likely with standard three.js loaders but could be a concern with custom implementations.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Filename or Metadata:** If the application displays the filename or metadata of the uploaded asset without proper sanitization, a malicious filename containing JavaScript could be injected and executed in the user's browser.
    * **Exploiting Loader Vulnerabilities:**  Bugs or vulnerabilities in the specific three.js loader being used (e.g., GLTFLoader, OBJLoader) could be exploited by crafting a model that triggers unexpected behavior or allows for code execution.

**4.2. Compromised External Asset Source:**

* **Attack Vector:** The application loads 3D assets from an external source (e.g., a CDN, a third-party API, or a developer-controlled server) that has been compromised by an attacker.
* **Potential Exploits:**
    * **Supply Chain Attack:** The attacker gains control of the external source and replaces legitimate 3D assets with malicious ones.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (Less Direct):** While outside the core scope, if the connection to the external source is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS), an attacker could intercept the asset download and replace it with a malicious version.
    * **Exploiting API Vulnerabilities:** If the external source is an API, vulnerabilities in the API itself could be exploited to inject or replace assets.

**4.3. Malicious Asset Included by Developers:**

* **Attack Vector:** A developer, either intentionally or unintentionally (e.g., through a compromised development environment or a malicious dependency), includes a harmful 3D asset directly within the application's codebase or deployment package.
* **Potential Exploits:**
    * **All the exploits listed under "User Upload of Malicious Asset" are applicable here.** The impact could be even more severe as these assets are implicitly trusted by the application.
    * **Backdoors or Hidden Functionality:** The malicious asset could contain hidden elements or logic designed to compromise the application or its users.

**4.4. Exploiting Asset Processing Pipelines:**

* **Attack Vector:** The application uses a backend process to process or convert 3D assets after they are uploaded. An attacker could supply a model that exploits vulnerabilities in this processing pipeline.
* **Potential Exploits:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Server:**  A specially crafted model could trigger vulnerabilities in the processing software (e.g., image manipulation libraries, 3D model conversion tools) leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * **File System Access:** The malicious model could be designed to read or write arbitrary files on the server during processing.

**5. Impact Assessment:**

The successful supply of a malicious 3D asset can have significant impacts:

* **Security Breaches:** Code execution within the browser or on the server can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and further attacks.
* **Denial of Service:** Crashing the application or the user's browser disrupts functionality and degrades user experience.
* **Data Corruption:** Malicious assets could potentially corrupt application data or user data.
* **Reputational Damage:** Security incidents can severely damage the reputation of the application and the development team.
* **Financial Loss:**  Downtime, recovery efforts, and potential legal repercussions can lead to financial losses.
* **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Malicious assets could be designed to mimic legitimate content and trick users into revealing sensitive information.

**6. Vulnerabilities Exploited:**

This attack path can exploit various vulnerabilities:

* **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization:** Failure to properly validate and sanitize uploaded 3D model files and their metadata.
* **Insecure Deserialization:** Vulnerabilities in the 3D model loaders that allow for the execution of arbitrary code during the deserialization process.
* **Insufficient Content Security Policy (CSP):** A weak or missing CSP can allow for the execution of malicious scripts embedded within the 3D asset or its metadata.
* **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:** Bugs or security flaws in the three.js library itself or its dependencies (though less likely).
* **Lack of Integrity Checks:** Failure to verify the integrity of 3D assets loaded from external sources.
* **Insufficient Security Awareness:** Developers and users may not be aware of the risks associated with malicious 3D assets.
* **Overly Permissive File Upload Policies:** Allowing the upload of file types that are more prone to containing executable content.

**7. Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risks associated with supplying malicious 3D assets, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **File Type Whitelisting:** Only allow the upload of specific, safe 3D model file types.
    * **Metadata Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize filenames, descriptions, and other metadata to prevent XSS.
    * **Content Inspection:**  Implement server-side checks to analyze the content of uploaded files for suspicious patterns or embedded code (though this can be complex for binary formats).
* **Secure 3D Asset Loading Practices:**
    * **Use Reputable Loaders:** Rely on well-maintained and actively developed three.js loaders.
    * **Keep Loaders Up-to-Date:** Regularly update three.js and its loaders to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    * **Isolate Loading Processes:** If possible, load and process 3D assets in isolated environments to limit the impact of potential exploits.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, including scripts and other potentially harmful content.
* **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI to ensure that assets loaded from CDNs or other external sources have not been tampered with.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and users about the risks associated with malicious 3D assets and best practices for handling them.
* **Secure Development Practices:** Follow secure coding principles to minimize vulnerabilities in the application's codebase.
* **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:** Implement measures to prevent attackers from repeatedly uploading potentially malicious files.
* **Consider Server-Side Rendering or Processing:**  Where feasible, perform critical processing or rendering of 3D assets on the server-side in a controlled environment to reduce the attack surface on the client-side.
* **Implement a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with Security Features:** If using external asset sources, choose a CDN with built-in security features like DDoS protection and WAF.

**8. Three.js Specific Considerations:**

* **Loader Choice:** Be mindful of the specific loaders used (e.g., GLTFLoader, OBJLoader, FBXLoader). Some loaders might have known vulnerabilities or handle certain file formats in less secure ways.
* **GLTF Extensions:** Be cautious when using GLTF extensions, especially those that allow for embedded JavaScript or external resource loading.
* **Custom Shaders:** If the application allows users to provide custom shaders, this introduces a significant security risk as shaders can execute arbitrary code on the GPU. This should be carefully controlled and potentially sandboxed.

**9. Conclusion:**

The "Supply Malicious 3D Asset" attack path presents a significant risk to applications utilizing three.js. A multi-layered security approach is crucial, encompassing strict input validation, secure loading practices, robust CSP, and ongoing security monitoring. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of such attacks, ensuring the security and integrity of their applications and the safety of their users.
