# Threat Model Analysis for mrdoob/three.js

## Threat: [Malicious 3D Model with Embedded Script](./threats/malicious_3d_model_with_embedded_script.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a 3D model file (e.g., glTF, OBJ) that, when parsed by Three.js, triggers the execution of embedded JavaScript code within the user's browser. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in the model parsing logic.

**Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.

**Affected Three.js Component:** `THREE.GLTFLoader`, `THREE.OBJLoader`, or other model loading modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and scripts from untrusted sources.
* Sanitize or validate 3D model files on the server-side before serving them to the client.
* Avoid using custom or untrusted model loaders if possible. Stick to well-maintained and vetted loaders.
* Regularly update the Three.js library to patch any known vulnerabilities in model parsing.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex 3D Model](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_3d_model.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a 3D model with an extremely high polygon count, excessive detail, or overly large textures, designed to overwhelm the client's browser during rendering by Three.js.

**Impact:** Client-side Denial of Service (DoS), causing the user's browser to become unresponsive or crash, degrading user experience.

**Affected Three.js Component:** `THREE.WebGLRenderer`, the rendering pipeline, potentially the model loading modules if they don't handle large models efficiently.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the size and complexity of uploaded or loaded 3D models.
* Use level-of-detail (LOD) techniques within Three.js to render simpler versions of models when they are far away.
* Optimize 3D models before deployment (reduce polygon count, compress textures).
* Implement loading progress indicators and potentially allow users to cancel long loading operations.

## Threat: [Loading External Resources from Untrusted Sources](./threats/loading_external_resources_from_untrusted_sources.md)

**Description:** The application uses Three.js to load 3D models, textures, or other assets from external, untrusted sources without proper validation. An attacker could control these sources and serve malicious content.

**Impact:** Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if a malicious script is served as a "resource," or the loading of inappropriate or harmful content.

**Affected Three.js Component:** `THREE.GLTFLoader`, `THREE.OBJLoader`, `THREE.TextureLoader`, `THREE.AudioLoader`, any Three.js module responsible for fetching external data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only load resources from trusted and known sources.
* Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks to ensure that fetched resources haven't been tampered with.
* Use a strict CSP to control the origins from which resources can be loaded.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Three.js Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_known_three_js_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of the Three.js library being used.

**Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service within the context of the Three.js application.

**Affected Three.js Component:** Any part of the library depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the Three.js library to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories related to Three.js.

## Threat: [Client-Side Denial of Service via Shader Exploits](./threats/client-side_denial_of_service_via_shader_exploits.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides custom shader code (vertex or fragment shaders) that is used by Three.js and is computationally expensive or contains infinite loops, causing the client's GPU to become overloaded and the browser to become unresponsive.

**Impact:** Client-side Denial of Service (DoS), impacting user experience.

**Affected Three.js Component:** `THREE.ShaderMaterial`, `THREE.RawShaderMaterial`, the shader compilation and rendering pipeline within `THREE.WebGLRenderer`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and test any custom shader code for performance and potential issues.
* Implement safeguards to prevent the execution of excessively complex or malicious shaders.
