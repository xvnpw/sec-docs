# Attack Surface Analysis for mrdoob/three.js

## Attack Surface: [Parsing Vulnerabilities in Model Loaders](./attack_surfaces/parsing_vulnerabilities_in_model_loaders.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted 3D model files can exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic of three.js's model loaders (e.g., GLTFLoader, OBJLoader, FBXLoader).
    *   **How three.js Contributes:** Three.js provides the libraries and functions to load and interpret various 3D model formats. If these loaders have bugs or are not robust against malformed input, they become an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted GLTF file that, when parsed by `GLTFLoader`, triggers a buffer overflow, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution on the client's machine.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service (client-side crash), potential remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep three.js library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement server-side validation and sanitization of uploaded model files before they are processed by three.js.
        *   Consider using a dedicated, sandboxed environment for parsing untrusted model files.
        *   Implement error handling to gracefully manage parsing failures and prevent application crashes.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure to Malicious User-Generated Content (UGC)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_to_malicious_user-generated_content__ugc_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to upload or provide 3D models or textures, these files could contain malicious content beyond just parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **How three.js Contributes:** Three.js directly renders the models and textures provided to it. If these assets contain embedded scripts or are designed to exploit browser features, three.js facilitates their execution or display.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a GLTF file that, while technically valid, includes JavaScript code within its extensions or animations that executes when the model is loaded and rendered by three.js, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to control the resources the application can load and execute.
        *   Sanitize and validate user-provided content thoroughly, removing potentially harmful elements.
        *   Isolate user-generated content in a separate domain or subdomain to limit the impact of potential attacks.
        *   Implement robust input validation on the server-side before serving assets to the client.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Loading of Assets from Untrusted Sources](./attack_surfaces/insecure_loading_of_assets_from_untrusted_sources.md)

*   **Description:** Loading 3D models, textures, or other assets from untrusted or unverified sources can expose the application to malicious content.
    *   **How three.js Contributes:** Three.js provides the functionality to load assets from various URLs. If developers do not carefully manage the sources of these assets, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** The application loads a critical 3D model from a third-party CDN that is later compromised, leading to the delivery of a malicious model to users.
    *   **Impact:** Malware injection, data breaches (if the malicious asset exfiltrates data), cross-site scripting (if the asset contains malicious scripts).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load assets from trusted and verified sources using HTTPS.
        *   Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that fetched resources have not been tampered with.
        *   Consider hosting critical assets on your own infrastructure.
        *   Regularly review and audit the sources of all loaded assets.
