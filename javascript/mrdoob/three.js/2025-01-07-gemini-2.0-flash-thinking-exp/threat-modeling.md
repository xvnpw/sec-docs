# Threat Model Analysis for mrdoob/three.js

## Threat: [Malicious 3D Model Injection](./threats/malicious_3d_model_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted 3D model file (e.g., glTF, OBJ, FBX) that, when loaded by the application using three.js loaders, exploits vulnerabilities within those loaders. This could involve embedding malicious scripts within the model data or crafting models that trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during the parsing process performed by three.js.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to three.js processing the malicious model), potential for Remote Code Execution (if vulnerabilities in three.js loaders allow), Cross-Site Scripting (if malicious scripts are executed by three.js or the browser during or after model loading).

**Affected Component:** `THREE.GLTFLoader`, `THREE.OBJLoader`, `THREE.FBXLoader`, and other model loader modules within the three.js library.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability and potential for RCE).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of all externally sourced 3D model files *before* passing them to three.js loaders.
* Use the latest version of three.js, as updates often include fixes for known loader vulnerabilities.
* Consider sandboxing the model loading process to limit the impact of potential exploits within three.js.

## Threat: [Shader Injection/Manipulation](./threats/shader_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker finds a way to inject or manipulate the shader code (vertex or fragment shaders) that is used by the three.js application's rendering pipeline. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in custom shader loading logic or by manipulating application logic that constructs shader programs passed to three.js's rendering components.

**Impact:** Visual defacement of the application's 3D scene, performance degradation or Denial of Service by injecting inefficient or infinite loop shaders that consume three.js's rendering resources, or potentially gaining unintended access to rendering context data (though less common in standard web environments).

**Affected Component:** `THREE.ShaderMaterial`, `THREE.RawShaderMaterial`, `THREE.WebGLRenderer` (specifically the parts of three.js responsible for shader compilation and use).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid dynamic construction of shader code based on user input.
* If custom shaders are necessary, ensure they are carefully reviewed and validated.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts (which might manipulate shaders) can be loaded.

## Threat: [Exploiting three.js Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_three_js_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker directly leverages known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the core three.js library code. This could involve exploiting flaws in core modules, rendering algorithms, or utility functions provided by three.js.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (if a critical vulnerability exists within three.js), information disclosure by exploiting flaws in three.js's data handling, Denial of Service by triggering bugs in three.js that lead to crashes or hangs, Cross-Site Scripting if vulnerabilities in three.js allow for script injection.

**Affected Component:** Various core modules and functions throughout the three.js library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE vulnerabilities), High (for other significant vulnerabilities like information disclosure or DoS).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep three.js updated to the latest stable version.** This is the most critical mitigation for this threat.
* Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for the three.js project to be aware of reported vulnerabilities.
* Implement a process for quickly patching or updating the library when vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed.
