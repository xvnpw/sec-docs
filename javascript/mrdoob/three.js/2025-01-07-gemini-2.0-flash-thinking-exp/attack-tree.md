## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Data Loading & Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_data_loading_&_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Inject Malicious 3D Models or Scenes [CRITICAL]
    *   This is a critical entry point where attackers attempt to introduce harmful data into the application.
*   **High-Risk Path:** Supply Crafted GLTF/OBJ/FBX Files -> Embed Malicious Scripts within Model Data [CRITICAL] -> Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CRITICAL]
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft 3D model files (like GLTF, OBJ, or FBX) and embed malicious JavaScript code within the model data (e.g., through extensions or metadata fields).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the complexity of the model parsing logic and the presence of exploitable features.
    *   **Impact:** High - Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of model file formats and XSS techniques.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires inspection of model file content and monitoring client-side script execution.

*   **Critical Node:** Manipulate Texture Loading [CRITICAL]
    *   This node highlights the risk associated with how the application loads and handles texture assets.
*   **High-Risk Path:** Redirect Texture URLs to Malicious Content -> Display Phishing Content or Execute Scripts [CRITICAL]
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the application dynamically loads textures based on user input or external sources, attackers can manipulate these URLs to point to malicious images or even HTML pages. These malicious resources can then be used for phishing attacks (by displaying fake login forms) or to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on how texture URLs are handled and validated by the application.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can lead to credential theft through phishing or full compromise via script execution.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires identifying and manipulating the mechanism for loading texture URLs.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring network requests for texture resources and analyzing the content being loaded.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Logic & Interaction Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_logic_&_interaction_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Exploit Custom Three.js Extensions/Modifications [CRITICAL]
    *   This node emphasizes the increased risk introduced by custom code.
*   **High-Risk Path:** Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Code [CRITICAL] -> Achieve Code Execution or Data Manipulation [CRITICAL]
    *   **Attack Vector:** Applications often extend three.js functionality with custom code. Attackers can analyze this custom code for vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, logic flaws, insecure API usage). Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client-side or manipulation of application data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends heavily on the security practices followed during the development of custom extensions.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can result in full compromise of the application and user data.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High - Requires reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis skills.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High - Requires code review and potentially runtime analysis of the custom extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities via Three.js [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_via_three_js__critical_.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Exploit WebGL Driver Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]
    *   This node represents a lower likelihood but extremely high impact scenario.
*   **High-Risk Path:** Leverage WebGL Context for Attacks -> Exploit WebGL Driver Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]
    *   **Attack Vector:** Three.js relies on the WebGL API, which interacts with the user's graphics drivers. While rare, vulnerabilities in these drivers can be exploited by carefully crafted WebGL calls or shader code. Successful exploitation could lead to browser crashes or, in more severe cases, remote code execution on the user's machine.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low - WebGL driver vulnerabilities are relatively rare and quickly patched.
    *   **Impact:** High - Potential for remote code execution, leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Effort:** Very High - Requires deep knowledge of WebGL, graphics drivers, and exploit development.
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Requires system-level monitoring and analysis of WebGL calls.

This breakdown highlights the most critical areas of concern for applications using three.js. Focusing security efforts on mitigating these high-risk paths and addressing these critical nodes will significantly improve the overall security posture of the application.
