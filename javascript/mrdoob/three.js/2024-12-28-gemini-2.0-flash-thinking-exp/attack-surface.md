* **Description:** Loading Maliciously Crafted 3D Assets
    * **How three.js contributes to the attack surface:** three.js provides loaders for various 3D file formats (e.g., glTF, OBJ, FBX). If these loaders have vulnerabilities or the asset itself is crafted to exploit browser or graphics driver bugs, it can be a point of attack.
    * **Example:** A specially crafted glTF file containing excessive geometry or triggers a buffer overflow in the parsing logic, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exploit).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only load 3D assets from trusted and verified sources.
        * Implement server-side validation and sanitization of uploaded assets before they are served to the client.
        * Keep the three.js library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the loaders.
        * Consider using a dedicated asset processing pipeline that includes security scanning.

* **Description:** Loading Malicious External Resources (Textures, Audio, etc.)
    * **How three.js contributes to the attack surface:** three.js often loads external resources like textures, audio files, and environment maps using URLs. If these URLs point to attacker-controlled servers, malicious content can be served.
    * **Example:** A texture file is replaced with an SVG containing malicious JavaScript, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when the texture is loaded and rendered.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Phishing, Data Exfiltration.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only load external resources from trusted and known origins.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which resources can be loaded.
        * Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that fetched resources haven't been tampered with.
        * Avoid dynamically constructing resource URLs based on user input without proper sanitization.

* **Description:** Shader Code Injection (if dynamically generated)
    * **How three.js contributes to the attack surface:** If the application dynamically generates shader code (GLSL) based on user input or data from untrusted sources, it can be vulnerable to shader code injection.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects malicious GLSL code that, when compiled and executed on the GPU, could be used to leak information or cause rendering issues.
    * **Impact:** Rendering manipulation, potential data exfiltration from the GPU, Denial of Service (GPU overload).
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid dynamically generating shader code based on untrusted input if possible.
        * If dynamic generation is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of arbitrary shader code.
        * Consider using pre-compiled shaders or a limited set of configurable shader options.
