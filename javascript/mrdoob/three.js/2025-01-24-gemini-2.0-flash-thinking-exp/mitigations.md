# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mrdoob/three.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate 3D Model File Formats (for Three.js Loaders)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_3d_model_file_formats__for_three_js_loaders_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Allowed Formats for Three.js:** Determine the necessary 3D model file formats that your three.js application needs to load using three.js loaders (e.g., GLTF, OBJ, FBX, using `GLTFLoader`, `OBJLoader`, `FBXLoader` etc.). Limit support in your application to only these formats within your three.js loading logic.
    2.  **Implement Format Check Before Three.js Loading:** Before using a three.js loader to process any 3D model file, check its file extension or MIME type to ensure it matches one of the allowed formats. This check should happen *before* passing the file to a three.js loader.
    3.  **Schema Validation for Three.js Loaders (if applicable):** For formats like GLTF loaded with `GLTFLoader`, consider using schema validation libraries *in conjunction with* the three.js loader to further verify the file structure conforms to the GLTF specification *after* it's parsed by `GLTFLoader` but before using the model in the scene.
    4.  **Reject Invalid Files Before Three.js Processing:** If a file does not match an allowed format or fails schema validation (if implemented), reject it and prevent it from being processed by any three.js loader. Provide an informative error message or log the error.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious File Upload Exploiting Three.js Loaders (High Severity):** Attackers could upload files disguised as supported 3D models, hoping to exploit vulnerabilities within three.js loaders if they process unexpected or malformed file types.
        *   **Unexpected Errors in Three.js Loading Process (Medium Severity):** Processing unsupported or malformed files by three.js loaders can lead to application crashes, unexpected rendering behavior, or denial of service due to errors within the three.js library's loading and parsing logic.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious File Upload Exploiting Three.js Loaders:** High risk reduction. Prevents potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in three.js loaders by ensuring only expected file types are processed.
        *   **Unexpected Errors in Three.js Loading Process:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces crashes and instability caused by feeding incompatible file formats to three.js loaders.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Implemented in the file upload handler on the backend server *before* files are passed to the frontend three.js application. Checks file extensions before allowing download to the frontend for three.js loading.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Schema validation for GLTF files loaded by `GLTFLoader` is not yet implemented. Only file extension check is in place before files reach the three.js loading stage. Deeper validation within the three.js loading process is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize 3D Model Data (Processed by Three.js)](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_3d_model_data__processed_by_three_js_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rely on Secure Three.js Parsers:** Primarily rely on the built-in loaders provided by three.js (`GLTFLoader`, `OBJLoader`, `FBXLoader`, etc.), as these are part of the actively maintained three.js library.
    2.  **Limit Three.js Parser Options:** When using three.js loaders, configure their options to disable or restrict features that are not strictly necessary and could be potential attack vectors. Check the documentation for each three.js loader for available options.
    3.  **Post-Load Data Sanitization (Consideration):** After a model is loaded by a three.js loader and represented as a three.js `Object3D` or similar structure, consider iterating through the object hierarchy and stripping unnecessary or potentially harmful data. This might involve removing custom user data or attributes that are not essential for rendering and could be exploited.
    4.  **Error Handling in Three.js Loading:** Implement robust error handling around the three.js model loading process. Use the error callbacks provided by three.js loaders to catch parsing errors or exceptions. If loading fails, log the error and gracefully handle the situation in your three.js application, preventing crashes or unexpected behavior in the 3D scene.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Model Files Processed by Three.js (Medium to High Severity):** If vulnerabilities exist in three.js loaders or the way three.js processes model data, attackers might inject scripts into model files that could be executed when three.js loads and renders the model.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Models Handled by Three.js (Medium Severity):** Crafted model files could exploit vulnerabilities in three.js loaders or rendering pipeline to cause excessive resource consumption or crashes *within the three.js rendering context*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS via Model Files Processed by Three.js:** Medium to High risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of script injection through model files by relying on (presumably) secure three.js loaders and potentially sanitizing data after loading.
        *   **DoS via Malformed Models Handled by Three.js:** Medium risk reduction. Improves application stability within the three.js rendering environment by handling loading errors and potentially limiting resource consumption during three.js processing.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Using three.js's built-in `GLTFLoader` and `OBJLoader`. Basic error handling is in place for loader errors in the three.js code.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No specific configuration to limit features of three.js loaders. No post-load data sanitization of three.js `Object3D` structures. No active vulnerability scanning specifically focused on three.js loader components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Texture and Image Validation (for Three.js Textures)](./mitigation_strategies/texture_and_image_validation__for_three_js_textures_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Allowed Image Formats for Three.js Textures:** Define the allowed image formats for textures that will be used in three.js materials (e.g., PNG, JPG, using `TextureLoader` or within material definitions).
    2.  **Format Validation Before Three.js Texture Loading:** Check the file extension or MIME type of texture files *before* passing them to three.js's `TextureLoader` or using them in material definitions.
    3.  **Image Size Limits for Three.js Textures:** Implement limits on the maximum dimensions and file size of texture images to prevent image bombs and resource exhaustion *within the three.js rendering pipeline*. These limits should be considered in the context of three.js performance and memory usage.
    4.  **Metadata Sanitization for Three.js Textures:** Use image processing libraries (outside of three.js itself) to sanitize image metadata *before* loading them as three.js textures, removing potentially malicious or privacy-sensitive information.
    5.  **Error Handling in Three.js Texture Loading:** Implement error handling for `TextureLoader` failures and invalid image formats within your three.js texture loading logic.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Image Bomb DoS via Three.js Texture Loading (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers could upload or link to specially crafted images (image bombs) that consume excessive resources when processed by three.js's texture handling, leading to denial of service *in the 3D rendering context*.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Image Metadata in Three.js Textures (Low Severity):** Image metadata, if not sanitized before being used as three.js textures, might contain sensitive information.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Image Bomb DoS via Three.js Texture Loading:** Medium to High risk reduction. Limits the impact of image bombs on three.js rendering by restricting image sizes and formats used as textures.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Image Metadata in Three.js Textures:** Low risk reduction. Reduces potential information leakage through image metadata associated with three.js textures.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic image format validation (file extension check) is implemented before textures are loaded by `TextureLoader`. Maximum image file size limit is configured on the server, affecting files before they reach the three.js texture loading stage.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No image dimension limits are enforced specifically for three.js textures. Metadata sanitization is not implemented before images are used as three.js textures. Deeper validation within the three.js texture loading process is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) for Three.js Asset Loading](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__for_three_js_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure CSP Header for Three.js Context:** Set up a Content Security Policy HTTP header in your web server configuration or application code, specifically considering the asset loading needs of your three.js application.
    2.  **`img-src` Directive for Three.js Textures:** Use `img-src` in your CSP to explicitly specify allowed origins for images and textures that will be loaded and used by three.js. Use `'self'` for same-origin assets or whitelist trusted domains from which three.js will load textures.
    3.  **`media-src` Directive for Three.js Media Textures (if needed):** If your three.js application uses video or audio textures (e.g., `VideoTexture`, `AudioLoader`), configure `media-src` similarly to `img-src` to control sources for these media files used by three.js.
    4.  **`connect-src` Directive for Three.js Data Loading (if needed):** If your three.js application fetches 3D models or other data via AJAX or WebSockets (e.g., using custom loaders or data fetching logic within three.js code), use `connect-src` to limit the allowed origins for these connections initiated by three.js code.
    5.  **Test and Refine CSP in Three.js Application:** Thoroughly test your CSP configuration to ensure it doesn't break the asset loading functionality of your three.js application and refine it as needed to balance security and the required asset sources for your 3D scenes.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via External Asset Loading in Three.js (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts by controlling the sources from which three.js can load textures, models, and other assets, limiting the attack surface within the 3D rendering context.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via External Requests from Three.js (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of malicious scripts or compromised assets loaded by three.js to send data to unauthorized external domains, reducing potential data leaks from within the 3D application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS via External Asset Loading in Three.js:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks related to assets loaded and used by three.js by strictly controlling loading sources.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via External Requests from Three.js:** Medium risk reduction. Limits potential data leakage initiated from within the three.js application due to compromised assets or scripts.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic CSP header is configured on the web server, including `default-src 'self'`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `img-src`, `media-src`, and `connect-src` directives are not specifically configured to restrict asset loading origins *for three.js assets* beyond the default. CSP is not actively monitored or refined in the context of three.js asset loading requirements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Three.js Library](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for_three_js_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI Hashes for Three.js Files:** Generate SRI hashes (SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512) specifically for the three.js library files that are included in your project (e.g., `three.min.js` if using a minified version). Tools or online generators can be used for this.
    2.  **Integrate SRI Attributes for Three.js `<script>` Tag:** Add the `integrity` attribute to the `<script>` tag that loads the three.js library in your HTML, including the generated SRI hashes.
    3.  **Verify Three.js SRI Implementation:** Test that SRI is correctly implemented for the three.js library by intentionally modifying the loaded three.js file (e.g., changing a single byte) and observing that the browser blocks the execution of three.js due to the integrity check failure. This confirms SRI is protecting the integrity of the three.js library itself.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **CDN Compromise/Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Three.js (High Severity):** Protects against scenarios where a CDN hosting the three.js library is compromised and malicious code is injected directly into the three.js library files that your application loads.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Three.js Library Delivery (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers modifying the three.js library files in transit during a man-in-the-middle attack, ensuring the integrity of the core three.js code.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **CDN Compromise/Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Three.js:** High risk reduction. Provides a strong defense against compromised CDNs or supply chain attacks specifically targeting the three.js library files.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Three.js Library Delivery:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the impact of MITM attacks by ensuring the integrity of the three.js library code during transfer.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   SRI is implemented for the three.js library file loaded from CDN in the main HTML file.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   SRI is not implemented for other potentially critical assets *used by three.js*, such as custom shaders or worker scripts if they were to be loaded from external sources. SRI is currently only focused on the main three.js library file.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates and Vulnerability Monitoring (for Three.js Library)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_and_vulnerability_monitoring__for_three_js_library_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Three.js Update Schedule:** Create a schedule for regularly updating the three.js library in your project to the latest stable version (e.g., monthly or quarterly). This is crucial for patching security vulnerabilities in three.js.
    2.  **Monitor Three.js Security Advisories and Release Notes:** Actively monitor the official three.js release notes, community forums, and any security-related communication channels to stay informed about security updates, bug fixes, and reported vulnerabilities *specifically in the three.js library*.
    3.  **Dependency Scanning Tools for Three.js:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into your development pipeline that are capable of checking for known vulnerabilities *specifically in the three.js library* and its dependencies (if any).
    4.  **Testing After Three.js Updates:** After updating three.js, thoroughly test your application's 3D scenes and functionality to ensure compatibility with the new three.js version and identify any regressions or new issues introduced by the update. Pay special attention to areas that might be affected by security-related changes in three.js.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Three.js Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched in newer versions of three.js.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Three.js (Medium Severity):** While updates cannot prevent zero-day attacks, staying updated reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities in three.js, as the community and developers are actively working on finding and fixing issues.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Three.js Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Directly addresses known vulnerabilities in the three.js library by applying patches and updates.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Three.js:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the overall attack surface and time window for potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in three.js.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Three.js library is updated manually when new versions are released, but no fixed schedule. Updates are often driven by feature needs rather than security considerations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No automated dependency scanning specifically for three.js vulnerabilities. No formal process for proactively monitoring three.js security advisories or dedicated testing focused on security aspects after three.js updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Management and Performance Considerations (in Three.js Scenes)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_management_and_performance_considerations__in_three_js_scenes_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Limit Model Complexity in Three.js Scenes:** Implement limits on the polygon count, number of objects, or other complexity metrics of 3D models that are loaded and rendered in three.js scenes. Reject models exceeding these limits to prevent performance issues and potential DoS.
    2.  **Texture Size Limits for Three.js Rendering:** Enforce maximum dimensions and file sizes for textures used in three.js materials to prevent excessive memory usage and performance degradation *within the three.js rendering pipeline*.
    3.  **Resource Quotas for Three.js Assets (if applicable):** If users can upload assets that are used in three.js scenes, implement resource quotas to limit the total resources (memory, GPU usage) that can be consumed by assets associated with each user or session in the three.js application.
    4.  **Optimize Three.js Rendering Performance:** Optimize your three.js scene setup, rendering pipeline, and asset loading strategies to minimize resource usage and improve performance. Techniques like level of detail (LOD) in three.js, texture compression formats supported by three.js, and efficient geometry management within three.js scenes are crucial. This helps prevent performance-based DoS attacks targeting the three.js rendering engine.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in Three.js Rendering (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overloading the application's 3D rendering capabilities by uploading or loading excessively complex models or textures that strain the three.js rendering engine and client resources.
        *   **Client-Side Performance Issues due to Three.js Scenes (Low to Medium Severity):** Improves application performance and user experience by preventing resource-intensive three.js scenes from causing lag, crashes, or excessive resource consumption on user devices, which could be unintentionally or intentionally exploited.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS via Resource Exhaustion in Three.js Rendering:** Medium to High risk reduction. Limits the impact of resource exhaustion attacks targeting three.js rendering by enforcing resource limits on assets used in 3D scenes.
        *   **Client-Side Performance Issues due to Three.js Scenes:** Medium risk reduction. Improves application stability and user experience related to three.js rendering performance by optimizing resource usage and preventing resource-intensive scenes.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic texture size limits are in place, indirectly affecting three.js texture loading. No explicit limits on model complexity *within the three.js scene loading and rendering process*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No comprehensive model complexity limits are enforced specifically for three.js scenes. No resource quotas for user-uploaded assets used in three.js scenes. Rendering optimization is ongoing but not systematically addressed from a security-focused resource management perspective for three.js.
