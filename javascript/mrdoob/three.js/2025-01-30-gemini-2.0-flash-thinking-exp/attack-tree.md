## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit three.js Library Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_three_js_library_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Known three.js Vulnerabilities (CVEs) (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector Details:** Attackers target publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of three.js. If the application uses a vulnerable version, attackers can exploit these known weaknesses.
        *   **Exploitation Methods:**  Crafting malicious inputs (scenes, models, API calls) that trigger the vulnerability. Publicly available exploits or proof-of-concept code might be adapted.
        *   **Potential Impacts:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), depending on the nature of the CVE.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Application's Improper Use of three.js (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_application's_improper_use_of_three_js__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Load Malicious or Untrusted 3D Models/Assets (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector Details:**  If the application loads 3D models from untrusted sources (user uploads, external APIs without validation), attackers can inject malicious content through these models.
        *   **Exploitation Methods:**
            *   **Malicious Model Parsing Exploitation:** Crafting models that exploit vulnerabilities in three.js's model parsing logic (e.g., buffer overflows, format-specific bugs).
            *   **Malicious Model Content Injection:** Embedding malicious scripts or links within model data (metadata, textures, custom attributes) if the application processes this data unsafely.
        *   **Potential Impacts:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), potentially data theft if parsing vulnerabilities are severe.
    *   **Insecure Handling of three.js Scene Data or User Input (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector Details:**  Vulnerabilities arise from improper handling of user input that controls the three.js scene or unsafe processing of scene data within the application.
        *   **Exploitation Methods:**
            *   **Data Injection via Scene Parameters:** Injecting malicious data through user input that directly manipulates three.js scene parameters (object positions, materials, etc.) to cause unintended behavior or trigger vulnerabilities.
            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via three.js Integration (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**  Injecting malicious data into the three.js scene that is then reflected in the application's UI without proper encoding, leading to XSS. This can occur if object names, metadata, or other scene information are displayed directly in the DOM.
        *   **Potential Impacts:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), visual disruption, unexpected application behavior, information leakage.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Social Engineering leveraging three.js Visuals (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__social_engineering_leveraging_three_js_visuals__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Social Engineering with Deceptive 3D Content:**
        *   **Attack Vector Details:** Attackers leverage the visually appealing and interactive nature of three.js to create deceptive 3D content for social engineering attacks.
        *   **Exploitation Methods:**
            *   Creating realistic-looking 3D environments mimicking legitimate websites for phishing attacks (credential theft).
            *   Embedding malicious links or drive-by downloads within seemingly harmless 3D experiences.
        *   **Potential Impacts:** Phishing, malware distribution, credential theft, account compromise, depending on the attacker's goals and the social engineering tactics used.
