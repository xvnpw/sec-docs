### 1. Regularly Update Three.js

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Three.js
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for Three.js Updates:**  Actively track releases and security advisories specifically for the three.js library on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and related community channels.
    2.  **Test Updates with Three.js Scenes:** When a new version is released, especially security patches, test it thoroughly with your application's three.js scenes and functionalities in a development environment. Focus on ensuring compatibility and no regressions in rendering or scene interactions.
    3.  **Update Three.js Package:** Use your project's package manager (npm, yarn) to update the `three` package to the latest stable version.
    4.  **Verify Scene Functionality:** After updating, re-test all three.js related features in your application to confirm that the update hasn't introduced any issues with scene loading, rendering, animations, or user interactions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Three.js Specific Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated three.js versions may contain vulnerabilities in its core rendering engine, loaders, or utilities that attackers could exploit to compromise the application or user's browser when processing 3D scenes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Three.js Specific Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of attacks targeting known flaws within the three.js library itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are generally aware of updates but the process is not strictly scheduled or automated for three.js specifically. Updates are usually done reactively or as part of general dependency updates.
    *   *Location:* Development practices, dependency management documentation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated monitoring for three.js specific security advisories and releases.
    *   Scheduled, proactive updates of the three.js library.
    *   Testing process specifically focused on three.js scene functionality after updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for Three.js Resources](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_content_security_policy__csp__for_three_js_resources.md)

### 2. Implement Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for Three.js Resources

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for Three.js Resources
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define CSP Directives for Three.js Assets:** Configure your CSP header to specifically control the loading of resources commonly used by three.js, such as:
        *   `img-src`: Restrict sources for textures used in three.js scenes.
        *   `media-src`: Control sources for video or audio textures.
        *   `object-src`: Limit sources for loading 3D models (e.g., GLTF, OBJ files).
        *   `script-src`: While three.js itself is a script, ensure this directive is strict to prevent loading malicious scripts that could interact with the three.js scene or application.
        *   `connect-src`: Control origins for fetching external resources like models or textures via AJAX or Fetch API within three.js.
    2.  **Whitelist Trusted Origins:**  Only whitelist trusted origins for loading three.js assets. Use `'self'` for resources hosted on your own domain and explicitly list trusted CDNs or asset servers. Avoid overly broad wildcards.
    3.  **Test CSP with Three.js Scenes:** Test your CSP policy by loading various three.js scenes that utilize different types of assets (textures, models from different origins). Ensure that legitimate resources load correctly and violations are reported for unauthorized sources.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Assets (High Severity):** Prevents loading of malicious textures, models, or other assets from untrusted sources that could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities or inject malicious content into the three.js scene.
    *   **Data Injection through Asset Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of data injection if attackers try to manipulate asset URLs to load unexpected or harmful content into the three.js scene.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Assets (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks through compromised or malicious three.js assets.
    *   **Data Injection through Asset Manipulation (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the impact of asset-related data injection attempts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a basic CSP, but it might not be specifically tailored to restrict three.js asset loading as granularly as possible.
    *   *Location:* Server configuration files (e.g., web server config, middleware).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Refine the existing CSP policy to include specific directives for three.js asset types (`img-src`, `media-src`, `object-src`, `connect-src`).
    *   Implement stricter whitelisting of origins for three.js assets.
    *   Test CSP policy specifically with various three.js scene configurations and asset loading scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce CORS for Three.js Asset Servers](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_cors_for_three_js_asset_servers.md)

### 3. Enforce CORS for Three.js Asset Servers

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce CORS for Three.js Asset Servers
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Three.js Asset Origins:** Determine all origins from which your application loads three.js assets (textures, models, etc.). This includes your application's domain and any external CDNs or asset servers.
    2.  **Configure CORS on Asset Servers:** For each server hosting three.js assets, configure CORS to explicitly allow requests only from your application's origin(s).
    3.  **Restrict `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`:** Set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on asset server responses to your application's domain. Avoid using the wildcard `*` unless absolutely necessary and with careful consideration of the security implications.
    4.  **Test CORS with Three.js Asset Loading:** Verify that three.js assets load correctly from allowed origins and are blocked when accessed from unauthorized origins. Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests and CORS headers during three.js scene loading.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Three.js Assets (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized websites or applications from directly accessing and embedding your three.js assets (models, textures), potentially protecting intellectual property or preventing resource theft.
    *   **Hotlinking and Resource Abuse (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of hotlinking, where other websites directly link to your three.js assets, consuming your bandwidth and potentially leading to DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Three.js Assets (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of unauthorized asset usage and potential intellectual property concerns.
    *   **Hotlinking and Resource Abuse (Medium Impact):**  Mitigates the risk of resource abuse and potential performance impacts from hotlinking.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. CORS might be configured for some backend APIs, but might not be consistently applied to all servers hosting three.js assets, especially CDNs or static asset servers.
    *   *Location:* Backend API server configurations, CDN configurations (potentially).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Ensure CORS is consistently configured on all servers specifically serving three.js assets (textures, models, etc.).
    *   Review and refine CORS policies for asset servers to be as restrictive as possible, allowing only necessary origins.
    *   Document CORS configuration for all three.js asset origins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate and Sanitize Three.js Resource URLs](./mitigation_strategies/validate_and_sanitize_three_js_resource_urls.md)

### 4. Validate and Sanitize Three.js Resource URLs

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate and Sanitize Three.js Resource URLs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Three.js URL Generation:** Pinpoint code sections where URLs for three.js resources (models, textures, etc.) are dynamically constructed, especially if user input or external data influences these URLs.
    2.  **Validate URL Format and Origin:** Implement validation to ensure dynamically generated URLs:
        *   Conform to expected URL formats.
        *   Point to allowed and trusted domains or origins.
        *   Target expected file types for three.js assets (e.g., `.gltf`, `.obj`, `.png`, `.jpg`).
    3.  **Sanitize User Input in URLs:** If user input is used in resource URLs, sanitize it to prevent:
        *   **Path Traversal:** Block attempts to navigate outside allowed resource directories (e.g., prevent ".." sequences).
        *   **Injection of Malicious Characters:** Encode user input to prevent injection of special characters that could alter the intended URL or cause unexpected behavior in three.js loaders.
    4.  **Error Handling for Invalid URLs:** Implement robust error handling if URL validation or sanitization fails. Prevent three.js from attempting to load invalid or potentially malicious URLs and display appropriate error messages to the user.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal Attacks via Asset Paths (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating asset paths to load files from unintended locations on the server, potentially exposing sensitive data or application code.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Asset Loading (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of SSRF if manipulated asset URLs are used to trigger requests to internal systems or external malicious sites through three.js asset loaders.
    *   **Data Injection into Three.js Scene via URLs (Medium Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious data or unintended scene elements by manipulating asset URLs to point to crafted files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal Attacks via Asset Paths (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities when loading three.js assets.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Asset Loading (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of SSRF attacks related to three.js asset loading.
    *   **Data Injection into Three.js Scene via URLs (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of data injection through manipulated asset URLs.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic validation might be present in some areas, but comprehensive URL sanitization and validation specifically for three.js resource URLs are likely missing, especially for user-influenced URLs.
    *   *Location:* Code sections where three.js resource URLs are dynamically generated.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review of all dynamic three.js resource URL generation points in the codebase.
    *   Implementation of robust URL validation and sanitization functions specifically tailored for three.js asset URLs.
    *   Centralized URL validation/sanitization logic for consistent enforcement across all three.js asset loading operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Handling and Injection Prevention in Three.js Scene Manipulation](./mitigation_strategies/input_handling_and_injection_prevention_in_three_js_scene_manipulation.md)

### 5. Input Handling and Injection Prevention in Three.js Scene Manipulation

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Handling and Injection Prevention in Three.js Scene Manipulation
*   **Description:**
    *   **Sanitize User Inputs Affecting Scene Rendering:**
        1.  **Identify User Input Points:** Locate all areas where user input (e.g., from forms, URL parameters, user actions) can influence the three.js scene (e.g., loading models by name, changing object properties, modifying materials).
        2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them to manipulate the three.js scene. This includes:
            *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure input data types match expected formats (e.g., numbers, strings, enums).
            *   **Range Checks:** Validate that numerical inputs are within acceptable ranges.
            *   **Whitelist Allowed Values:** If possible, use whitelists to restrict input to a predefined set of allowed values (e.g., for model names, material types).
            *   **String Sanitization:** Sanitize string inputs to remove or encode potentially harmful characters that could be interpreted as code or commands within three.js or related systems.
    *   **Avoid `eval()` and `Function()` Constructors with User Input in Three.js Context:**
        1.  **Code Review for `eval()` and `Function()`:**  Thoroughly review your codebase to ensure that `eval()` or `Function()` constructors are not used to process user-provided strings in the context of three.js scene manipulation, shader code generation, or any other dynamic code execution related to three.js.
        2.  **Use Safe Alternatives:** If dynamic behavior is needed, explore safer alternatives to `eval()` and `Function()`, such as:
            *   Using predefined functions or methods within three.js to modify scene properties.
            *   Employing data-driven approaches where user input selects from pre-existing options rather than generating code.
    *   **Limit File Upload Functionality for Three.js Assets:**
        1.  **Restrict File Types:** If your application allows users to upload 3D models or textures for use in three.js scenes, strictly limit the allowed file types to only necessary and safe formats (e.g., `.gltf`, `.glb`, `.png`, `.jpg`).
        2.  **Server-Side Validation and Sanitization:** Perform thorough file validation and sanitization on the server-side after upload. This includes:
            *   **File Type Verification:**  Verify file types based on file headers and content, not just file extensions.
            *   **Malware Scanning:** Scan uploaded files for malware and malicious content.
            *   **Content Sanitization:**  If possible, sanitize file content to remove potentially harmful elements (e.g., embedded scripts in model files, malicious metadata in images).
        3.  **Sandboxed Processing:** Consider processing uploaded files in a sandboxed environment to limit the potential impact of malicious files on your server infrastructure.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Scene Manipulation (High Severity):**  Prevents XSS attacks where malicious scripts are injected through user input that manipulates the three.js scene, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code in the user's browser.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via `eval()`/`Function()` (Critical Severity):**  Eliminates the risk of RCE vulnerabilities if `eval()` or `Function()` are misused with user input in the context of three.js, which could allow attackers to gain full control of the server or client.
    *   **Malicious File Uploads (High Severity):**  Mitigates the risk of users uploading malicious 3D models or textures that could contain malware, exploits, or trigger vulnerabilities in three.js or the browser when processed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Scene Manipulation (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks related to user-controlled scene manipulation.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via `eval()`/`Function()` (Critical Impact):**  Eliminates the risk of critical RCE vulnerabilities from unsafe code execution practices.
    *   **Malicious File Uploads (High Impact):**  Reduces the risk of malware infections and exploitation through malicious file uploads.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some input validation might be present, but comprehensive sanitization, prevention of `eval()`/`Function()` misuse, and robust file upload security for three.js assets are likely missing or incomplete.
    *   *Location:* Code sections handling user input and three.js scene manipulation, file upload handlers (if applicable).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough code review to identify all user input points affecting three.js scenes.
    *   Implementation of comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all relevant user inputs.
    *   Code review to eliminate or replace any usage of `eval()` or `Function()` with user input in three.js contexts.
    *   Implementation of robust file upload validation, sanitization, and malware scanning for three.js asset uploads.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Scene Performance:** Analyze the performance of your three.js scenes, particularly under heavy load or when rendering complex models. Identify potential bottlenecks related to polygon count, texture sizes, shader complexity, and resource loading.
    2.  **Reduce Polygon Count:** Optimize 3D models to reduce polygon counts where possible without significantly impacting visual quality. Use techniques like:
        *   **Decimation:** Reduce polygon density of models using decimation algorithms.
        *   **Level of Detail (LOD):** Implement LOD techniques to use lower-polygon models for distant objects.
        *   **Geometry Instancing:** Use instancing to efficiently render multiple copies of the same geometry.
    3.  **Optimize Textures:** Optimize textures to reduce file sizes and memory usage:
        *   **Texture Compression:** Use compressed texture formats (e.g., DDS, KTX2) to reduce download sizes and GPU memory footprint.
        *   **Texture Atlases:** Combine multiple smaller textures into texture atlases to reduce draw calls and improve performance.
        *   **Mipmapping:** Use mipmaps to optimize texture rendering at different distances.
        *   **Appropriate Texture Resolution:** Use texture resolutions that are appropriate for the viewing distance and detail level. Avoid unnecessarily high-resolution textures.
    4.  **Simplify Shaders:** Optimize shader code to reduce computational complexity. Avoid overly complex shader effects that can strain the GPU, especially on lower-end devices.
    5.  **Efficient Resource Loading:** Optimize resource loading to minimize loading times and prevent resource exhaustion:
        *   **Asynchronous Loading:** Load three.js assets asynchronously to prevent blocking the main thread and improve responsiveness.
        *   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce redundant asset downloads.
        *   **Progressive Loading:** Use progressive loading techniques to display low-resolution versions of assets quickly and progressively load higher-resolution details.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Scene Complexity (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from crafting or providing overly complex three.js scenes that can overwhelm the user's browser, leading to performance degradation, crashes, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Scene Complexity (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of client-side DoS attacks caused by excessively complex three.js scenes and improves overall application performance and user experience.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some scene optimization might be done on a case-by-case basis, but a systematic approach to scene complexity optimization for DoS mitigation is likely missing.
    *   *Location:* 3D model creation and optimization processes, three.js scene development practices.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized guidelines and best practices for optimizing three.js scene complexity for performance and DoS mitigation.
    *   Performance testing and analysis of three.js scenes to identify and address complexity bottlenecks.
    *   Integration of scene optimization techniques (LOD, instancing, texture optimization) into the scene development workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Evaluate and Vet Three.js Third-Party Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_evaluate_and_vet_three_js_third-party_extensions.md)

### 7. Carefully Evaluate and Vet Three.js Third-Party Extensions
