# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, three.js, aims to provide an accessible and powerful JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics in web browsers. It targets web developers who want to incorporate 3D elements into their websites and applications without needing deep expertise in WebGL or 3D graphics programming.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Lower the barrier to entry for web-based 3D graphics development.
  - Provide a comprehensive and well-documented API for 3D rendering.
  - Foster a strong community around the library for support and contributions.
  - Ensure cross-browser compatibility and performance.
  - Maintain the library as open-source and freely available.

- Most important business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited in applications using three.js, leading to potential harm to end-users and reputational damage.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting the distribution channels (e.g., npm, CDN) could compromise the library and applications using it.
  - Lack of consistent security updates and maintenance could lead to unaddressed vulnerabilities.
  - Misuse of the library by developers who are not security-conscious could introduce vulnerabilities in their applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Community Review -  The project benefits from community contributions and issue reporting, which can help identify potential bugs and security issues. Implemented: GitHub community engagement.
  - security control: Standard JavaScript Development Practices - The project likely follows general JavaScript development practices, which may include some level of basic input validation and secure coding principles. Implemented: Codebase (implicitly).

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Contributions - Security is partially reliant on the community to identify and report vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure - Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities can be exploited before patches are widely adopted.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - The project depends on other JavaScript libraries, which may have their own vulnerabilities.

- Recommended security controls:
  - recommended security control: Automated Security Scanning (SAST/DAST) - Implement automated static and dynamic analysis security testing in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - recommended security control: Dependency Scanning - Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
  - recommended security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
  - recommended security control: Secure Release Process - Implement a secure release process that includes security checks and code signing to ensure the integrity of distributed artifacts.
  - recommended security control: Security Awareness Training for Contributors - Provide security awareness training for core contributors to promote secure coding practices.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, as it's a client-side library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using three.js.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using three.js.
  - Input Validation:
    - The library should handle various input data formats (e.g., 3D model files, textures, user interactions) robustly and validate them to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    - Input validation should be applied to any user-provided data that influences rendering or scene construction.
  - Cryptography:
    - If the library handles sensitive data (e.g., in custom shaders or data processing), appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered. However, for a rendering library, direct cryptographic requirements are less common.
    - Ensure that any dependencies used for cryptographic operations are secure and up-to-date.
  - General Security Practices:
    - Follow secure coding practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and injection attacks. While three.js itself is less directly vulnerable to CSRF, applications using it might be. XSS is a potential concern if three.js is used to render user-generated content without proper sanitization in the application layer.

Deployment of three.js is primarily focused on making the library available to web developers for inclusion in their projects. There are multiple deployment options:

- npm Registry: Developers can install three.js as a dependency in their projects using npm or yarn.
- CDN: Developers can include three.js directly in their HTML files by referencing a CDN URL.
- GitHub Releases: Developers can download specific versions of three.js from GitHub releases.
- Self-hosting: Developers can download three.js and host it on their own servers.

We will focus on the CDN deployment scenario as it's a common and important method for distributing JavaScript libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process we are trying to protect:
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the three.js library as a widely used and trusted open-source project.
  - Ensuring that applications built with three.js are not vulnerable due to security flaws in the library itself.
  - Protecting the reputation of the three.js project and its maintainers.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Source code: Publicly available, but integrity is crucial to prevent malicious modifications. Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: High.
  - Build artifacts (npm package, CDN files): Publicly distributed, but integrity is paramount to prevent supply chain attacks. Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: High.
  - Project infrastructure (GitHub repository, CI/CD pipeline): Access control and integrity are important to prevent unauthorized modifications and ensure secure builds. Sensitivity: Confidentiality and Integrity: Medium.
  - User data (related to three.js project itself, not applications using it): Minimal user data collected directly by the three.js project (e.g., GitHub issues, forum posts if any). Sensitivity: Low.
