# Attack Surface Analysis for mrdoob/three.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious 3D Models (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_3d_models__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in three.js model loaders by providing crafted 3D model files.
*   **three.js Contribution:** three.js provides built-in loaders (e.g., `GLTFLoader`, `OBJLoader`, `FBXLoader`) to parse various 3D model formats. Vulnerabilities within the parsing logic of these three.js loaders can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted GLTF file is designed to trigger a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability within the `GLTFLoader` in three.js. When the application uses three.js to load this malicious model, it could lead to a browser crash, unexpected behavior, or potentially, in more severe scenarios, remote code execution (though less likely within a browser sandbox, but still a high risk).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (browser crash), potential for unexpected application behavior, theoretical risk of remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Model Validation:** Implement robust server-side and/or client-side validation of 3D model files *before* they are loaded by three.js. This includes checking file integrity, format correctness, and complexity limits.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Utilize CSP to restrict the origins from which three.js is allowed to load 3D models, limiting exposure to potentially malicious sources. Use directives like `img-src`, `media-src`, or `default-src` to control allowed sources.
    *   **Regularly Update three.js:**  Crucially, keep the three.js library updated to the latest stable version. This ensures that you benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the three.js maintainers, which often address vulnerabilities in model loaders.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Limited Effectiveness):** While full sanitization of complex model files is challenging, basic checks for file type and header information can offer a minimal layer of initial defense.

## Attack Surface: [User-Provided Shader Code (Critical Severity)](./attack_surfaces/user-provided_shader_code__critical_severity_.md)

*   **Description:**  Direct shader injection and execution through three.js's `ShaderMaterial` when user-provided shader code is permitted.
*   **three.js Contribution:** three.js's `ShaderMaterial` and `ShaderChunk` features enable developers to use custom shader code. If applications expose mechanisms for users to supply or modify this shader code, it creates a direct pathway for shader injection attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code disguised within a fragment shader string provided through a user interface. While direct JavaScript execution from shaders is not the primary concern in WebGL, a carefully crafted shader could:
        *   **Exfiltrate Data:** Read pixel data representing sensitive information rendered in the scene and transmit it to an external server.
        *   **Cause Denial of Service:**  Create an infinite loop or computationally intensive operations within the shader, leading to GPU overload and browser/system freeze.
        *   **Manipulate Rendering for Phishing:**  Visually alter the rendered scene to mimic legitimate UI elements for phishing or deceptive purposes.
*   **Impact:** Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service (GPU overload, browser crash), Visual Manipulation and Deception, potential for Cross-Site Scripting if shader output can influence the DOM (indirectly).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate User-Provided Shaders:** The most secure approach is to completely avoid allowing users to provide or modify shader code directly.
    *   **Predefined Shader Library (Recommended Alternative):** Offer a curated and rigorously vetted library of pre-approved shaders that users can select from. This removes the risk of arbitrary code injection.
    *   **Restrict Shader Functionality (If Unavoidable):** If user-provided shaders are absolutely necessary for application functionality, severely restrict the available shader language features and APIs. Limit access to texture lookups, complex mathematical functions, and any features that could be abused for data exfiltration or denial of service.
    *   **Code Review and Static Analysis (For Custom Shaders):** If you must use custom shaders (even predefined ones), implement rigorous code review processes and utilize static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities or performance issues in the shader code itself.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated three.js Library (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/outdated_three_js_library__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Utilizing an outdated version of the three.js library that contains known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
*   **three.js Contribution:** Directly related to the dependency on the three.js library. Like any software, three.js may have security vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched in newer releases. Using older versions leaves applications vulnerable to these known issues.
*   **Example:** A publicly documented vulnerability is discovered in three.js version r145 that allows for a Denial of Service attack when processing specific types of 3D models. An application still using version r145 becomes vulnerable to this attack if an attacker can provide a model that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability present in the outdated version. It can range from Denial of Service to more serious issues if the vulnerability allows for data breaches or, in less likely browser scenarios, remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maintain Up-to-Date three.js:**  Establish a process for regularly updating the three.js library to the latest stable release. This is the most critical mitigation.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Integrate dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) into your development workflow to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in the three.js version you are using.
    *   **Monitor three.js Security Advisories and Release Notes:**  Actively monitor the official three.js repository, release notes, and any security advisories published by the three.js team or the community to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities and necessary updates.
    *   **Automated Dependency Updates:** Consider using automated dependency update tools to streamline the process of keeping three.js and other dependencies up-to-date.
