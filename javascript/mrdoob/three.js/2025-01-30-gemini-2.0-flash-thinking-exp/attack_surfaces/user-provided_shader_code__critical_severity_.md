### 4. Deep Analysis of User-Provided Shader Code Attack Surface

#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack Vector: Shader Injection

Shader injection is a code injection attack that targets the shader programs executed by the GPU in WebGL applications. In the context of three.js, this attack surface arises when applications allow users to provide or modify shader code, typically through the `ShaderMaterial` feature.

**How it Works:**

1.  **User Input Mechanism:** The application provides a mechanism for users to input shader code. This could be a text area in a UI, an API endpoint accepting shader code, or even reading shader code from a file uploaded by the user.
2.  **`ShaderMaterial` in three.js:** The application uses three.js's `ShaderMaterial` to create materials for rendering objects. `ShaderMaterial` accepts `vertexShader` and `fragmentShader` properties as strings, which define the shader programs.
3.  **Direct Injection:** If the user-provided shader code is directly passed as the value for `vertexShader` or `fragmentShader` in `ShaderMaterial` without proper sanitization or validation, it becomes directly executable shader code.
4.  **GPU Execution:** When three.js renders objects using this `ShaderMaterial`, the injected shader code is compiled and executed on the user's GPU.

**Key Characteristics of Shader Injection:**

*   **Client-Side Execution:** Shader code executes on the client's GPU, within the browser's WebGL context.
*   **Limited Direct System Access:**  Shaders, by design, have limited direct access to the operating system or JavaScript environment. They primarily operate on graphics data. However, this doesn't mean they are harmless.
*   **Indirect Impact:** While direct JavaScript execution is not the primary concern, malicious shaders can indirectly cause significant harm by manipulating rendering, exfiltrating data through rendering channels, and causing denial of service through GPU overload.

#### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis & Exploitation Scenarios

**4.2.1. Data Exfiltration:**

*   **Pixel Data Extraction:** Shaders can read pixel data from the framebuffer. A malicious fragment shader can be crafted to:
    *   Render sensitive information (e.g., user data, API keys, tokens) into a specific area of the rendering context, even if visually obscured.
    *   Read the pixel data from this area using shader built-in functions.
    *   Encode this data into pixel colors of the rendered output in a way that is visually inconspicuous or disguised within normal rendering.
    *   The application's JavaScript code (or even another malicious shader if output is reused) can then read back the rendered pixels from the canvas using `readPixels` and decode the exfiltrated data.
    *   This data can then be sent to an attacker-controlled server via `fetch` or similar web APIs initiated from the JavaScript context (which is outside the shader itself, but enabled by the shader's actions).

**Example Scenario:**

1.  Attacker injects a fragment shader that renders a hidden rectangle containing sensitive data encoded in pixel colors.
2.  The application, or attacker-controlled JavaScript, reads pixels from the canvas using `readPixels`.
3.  The attacker's script decodes the data from the pixel colors and sends it to an external server.

**4.2.2. Denial of Service (DoS):**

*   **Infinite Loops:**  A malicious shader can contain infinite loops or computationally intensive operations that consume excessive GPU resources.
    *   **Fragment Shader Loops:**  Fragment shaders are executed for each pixel, making them particularly effective for DoS. An infinite loop in a fragment shader can quickly overload the GPU.
    *   **Complex Calculations:**  Even without infinite loops, shaders can perform extremely complex mathematical calculations or texture lookups that strain the GPU.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Shaders can allocate large textures or buffers, potentially exhausting GPU memory and leading to crashes or system instability.

**Example Scenario:**

1.  Attacker injects a fragment shader with an infinite `while(true)` loop.
2.  When the application attempts to render using this shader, the GPU becomes overloaded trying to execute the infinite loop for every pixel.
3.  This can lead to browser freeze, tab crash, or even system-wide instability, effectively causing a denial of service for the user.

**4.2.3. Visual Manipulation and Deception (Phishing):**

*   **UI Spoofing:** Malicious shaders can alter the rendered scene to mimic legitimate UI elements, buttons, or forms.
    *   An attacker could overlay a fake login form on top of the actual application interface, tricking users into entering credentials that are then captured by the attacker (potentially through data exfiltration techniques described above).
    *   This can be used for phishing attacks or to deceive users into performing unintended actions.
*   **Content Manipulation:** Shaders can arbitrarily modify the visual appearance of objects and scenes, potentially altering critical information or misleading users.

**Example Scenario:**

1.  Attacker injects shaders that replace legitimate UI elements with visually similar but malicious ones.
2.  Users interact with the fake UI elements, believing they are interacting with the real application.
3.  This can lead to credential theft, unauthorized actions, or misinformation dissemination.

**4.2.4. Potential for Indirect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   While shaders cannot directly execute JavaScript, if the *output* of the shader (rendered pixels) can somehow influence the DOM or application logic in a way that leads to JavaScript execution, it could create an indirect XSS vulnerability.
*   This is a less direct and less likely scenario but worth considering if the application processes or reuses the rendered output in complex ways. For example, if rendered text from a shader is somehow parsed and used to dynamically generate DOM elements.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful shader injection attacks can be **Critical**, as indicated in the initial attack surface description.

*   **Confidentiality (Data Exfiltration):** High. Sensitive data rendered in the scene can be extracted and transmitted to attackers.
*   **Availability (Denial of Service):** High. GPU overload and browser/system crashes can render the application unusable and disrupt user workflows.
*   **Integrity (Visual Manipulation & Deception):** Medium to High.  Visual manipulation can lead to user deception, phishing attacks, and compromised user trust.
*   **Indirect XSS Potential:** Low to Medium (depending on application architecture). While less direct, the potential for indirect XSS exists and could escalate the impact.

**Overall Risk Severity: Critical** due to the potential for significant data breaches, denial of service, and user deception.

#### 4.4. Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

**4.4.1. Eliminate User-Provided Shaders (Strongly Recommended):**

*   **Effectiveness:**  **Highest**. Completely eliminates the attack surface. If users cannot provide shaders, they cannot inject malicious shaders.
*   **Feasibility:**  Depends on application requirements. If shader customization is not core functionality, this is the most secure and often feasible option.
*   **Recommendation:** **Prioritize this mitigation strategy.**  Carefully evaluate if user-provided shaders are truly essential. If not, remove the functionality entirely.

**4.4.2. Predefined Shader Library (Recommended Alternative):**

*   **Effectiveness:** **High**. Significantly reduces risk by limiting users to vetted and controlled shaders.
*   **Feasibility:**  Good. Allows for customization while maintaining security. Requires initial effort to create and maintain the library.
*   **Recommendation:** **Implement a predefined shader library if customization is required.**  Curate a library of shaders that meet user needs and are rigorously reviewed for security and performance. Provide clear documentation and examples for users.

**4.4.3. Restrict Shader Functionality (If Unavoidable - Use with Extreme Caution):**

*   **Effectiveness:** **Medium to Low**. Difficult to implement effectively and maintain security.  Attackers may find ways to bypass restrictions.
*   **Feasibility:**  Technically challenging and may limit application functionality. Requires deep understanding of shader language and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Recommendation:** **Avoid this approach if possible.**  If absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict restrictions and combine with rigorous code review and static analysis.  Focus on limiting access to:
    *   Texture lookups (especially external textures).
    *   Complex mathematical functions (potential for DoS).
    *   Outputting data in a way that can be easily exfiltrated (e.g., encoding data in pixel colors).
    *   Shader preprocessor directives that could be abused.
    *   Consider using a shader language subset or a sandboxed shader environment (if such tools exist and are reliable).

**4.4.4. Code Review and Static Analysis (Essential for Any Custom Shaders):**

*   **Effectiveness:** **Medium to High (depending on rigor and tools).**  Helps identify known vulnerabilities and coding errors in shaders.
*   **Feasibility:**  Good.  Essential practice for any code, especially security-sensitive code like shaders.
*   **Recommendation:** **Mandatory for any custom shaders, even predefined ones.**
    *   Implement a rigorous code review process involving security-conscious developers.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools specifically designed for shader languages (if available and mature).
    *   Focus on identifying potential infinite loops, excessive resource usage, and data exfiltration patterns.

**Additional Recommendations:**

*   **Input Sanitization (Limited Effectiveness for Shaders):** While general input sanitization is crucial, it's **extremely difficult and unreliable** to sanitize shader code effectively against all potential malicious payloads.  Shader languages are complex, and subtle variations can introduce vulnerabilities. **Do not rely solely on input sanitization for shader code.**
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate potential indirect XSS risks and restrict the capabilities of the application in case of successful shader injection.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the shader injection attack surface.
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Train developers on the risks of shader injection and secure coding practices for WebGL applications.

**Prioritized Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Eliminate User-Provided Shaders (if feasible).**
2.  **Implement a Predefined Shader Library (if customization is required).**
3.  **Mandatory Code Review and Static Analysis for all shaders.**
4.  **Implement a strong CSP.**
5.  **Regular Security Audits.**

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk associated with the "User-Provided Shader Code" attack surface and enhance the security of the three.js application.
