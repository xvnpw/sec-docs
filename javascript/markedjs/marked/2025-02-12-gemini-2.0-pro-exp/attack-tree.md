## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: `[G] -> [C] -> [C2]`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1___g__-__c__-__c2__.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents the attacker exploiting misconfigurations or insecure usage of the `marked` library, specifically focusing on the use of unsafe extensions or custom renderers. This is a high-risk path due to the combination of the likelihood of misconfigurations and the high impact of vulnerabilities in extensions/renderers.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **[C] Exploit misconfiguration or insecure usage:** The attacker identifies that the application using `marked` has been configured insecurely or uses the library in a way that introduces vulnerabilities. This could involve a lack of input validation, improper output encoding, or other security oversights.
    2.  **[C2] Use of unsafe extensions or custom renderers:** The attacker leverages the misconfiguration to introduce or exploit vulnerabilities within custom renderers or third-party extensions. This is the critical step where the vulnerability is introduced or exploited.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user input, both before and after processing with `marked`.
    *   Avoid custom renderers if possible; use built-in features.
    *   Thoroughly vet any third-party extensions before using them.
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   Regularly review the application's configuration and code for security best practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: `[G] -> [C] -> [C2] -> [C2a]`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2___g__-__c__-__c2__-__c2a__.md)

*   **Description:** This is a specific instance of High-Risk Path 1, where the attacker overrides a default renderer function with malicious JavaScript code. This leads directly to code execution.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **[C] Exploit misconfiguration or insecure usage:** (Same as above).
    2.  **[C2] Use of unsafe extensions or custom renderers:** (Same as above).
    3.  **[C2a] Override default renderer with malicious code:** The attacker finds a way to inject their own JavaScript code into a renderer function. This could be through a configuration vulnerability, a flaw in how the application handles user input, or a vulnerability in a custom extension.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Prevent users from influencing or providing renderer functions.
    *   If custom renderers are necessary, rigorously sanitize any user-provided data used within them.
    *   Use a code review process to ensure that renderer functions are secure.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: `[G] -> [C] -> [C2] -> [C2b]`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3___g__-__c__-__c2__-__c2b__.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves the attacker exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party `marked` extension.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **[C] Exploit misconfiguration or insecure usage:** (Same as above).
    2.  **[C2] Use of unsafe extensions or custom renderers:** (Same as above).
    3.  **[C2b] Use a vulnerable 3rd-party extension:** The attacker identifies and utilizes a third-party extension that contains a known or unknown vulnerability. They then craft input that triggers this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Only use extensions from trusted sources.
    *   Thoroughly review the code of any third-party extensions for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Keep extensions updated to the latest versions.
    *   Monitor for security advisories related to any extensions used.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: `[G] -> [C] -> [C2] -> [C2c]`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4___g__-__c__-__c2__-__c2c__.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by insecurely handling user input *within* a custom extension or renderer, even if the extension itself is not inherently malicious.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **[C] Exploit misconfiguration or insecure usage:** (Same as above).
    2.  **[C2] Use of unsafe extensions or custom renderers:** (Same as above).
    3.  **[C2c] Insecurely handle user input within extensions:** The attacker provides specially crafted input that, while not directly exploiting a known vulnerability in the extension, takes advantage of poor input sanitization or validation *within* the extension's code.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Ensure that *all* user input processed by extensions or custom renderers is rigorously sanitized and validated.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing extensions, paying close attention to input handling.
    *   Use a linter and static analysis tools to identify potential security issues in extension code.
