# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for markedjs/marked

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict `marked` Configuration and Sanitization within `marked`](./mitigation_strategies/strict__marked__configuration_and_sanitization_within__marked_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy:** Strict `marked` Configuration and Sanitization within `marked`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Deprecated `sanitize`:**  If you are using an older version of `marked` (prior to v5), explicitly set `sanitize: false` in the `marked` options.  This prevents reliance on the outdated and less secure built-in sanitization. *Do not use `sanitize: true`.*
    2.  **Enable `mangle`:** Set `mangle: true` in the `marked` options. This obfuscates email addresses rendered from Markdown, making them harder for bots to harvest.  Example: `marked.parse(markdownString, { mangle: true });`
    3.  **Custom `sanitizer` Function (Pre-v5):** If using a `marked` version before v5, and *only* if you cannot upgrade, define a custom `sanitizer` function.  This function receives the *already rendered* HTML and should return the sanitized HTML.  *Strongly* consider using a library like DOMPurify *within* this function.  Example:
        ```javascript
        marked.parse(markdownString, {
          sanitizer: function(html) {
            return DOMPurify.sanitize(html); // Use DOMPurify here!
          }
        });
        ```
        *   **Critical Note:** If you are using `marked` v5 or later, this approach is *not* recommended. Rely on external sanitization with DOMPurify *after* `marked` has rendered the HTML.
    4.  **Review and Restrict Extensions:** If you use `marked` extensions (using `marked.use()`), thoroughly review the source code of *each* extension.  Ensure that any HTML generated by the extension is properly sanitized.  If the extension generates HTML, you *must* sanitize it, ideally using DOMPurify, within the extension's code.
    5.  **Review and Sanitize Custom Renderers:** If you override `marked`'s default renderers (e.g., to customize how links or images are rendered), you are *completely responsible* for sanitizing the HTML output of your custom renderers.  Use DOMPurify within the renderer function to sanitize any user-provided data (like URLs or image alt text). Example:
        ```javascript
        const renderer = {
          link(href, title, text) {
            const sanitizedHref = DOMPurify.sanitize(href, { ALLOWED_TAGS: ['a'], ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href'] });
            return `<a href="${sanitizedHref}">${text}</a>`;
          }
        };
        marked.use({ renderer });
        ```

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS (Severity: Medium):** By disabling the deprecated `sanitize` and carefully reviewing/sanitizing extensions and renderers, you reduce the attack surface within `marked` itself.  However, this is *not* a replacement for a dedicated HTML sanitizer like DOMPurify.
    *   **Email Harvesting (Severity: Low):** `mangle: true` helps prevent automated email address scraping.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Extensions/Renderers (Severity: Variable - depends on the extension/renderer):** Careful review and *mandatory* sanitization within custom extensions and renderers are crucial to prevent them from introducing vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low *only when combined with external sanitization*.  Without external sanitization, the risk remains significant.
    *   **Email Harvesting:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Extensions/Renderers:** Risk depends entirely on the quality of the review and the thoroughness of the sanitization within the extension/renderer code.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `mangle: true` is set globally in `frontend/config/markedConfig.js`.
    *   The deprecated `sanitize` option is *not* used (explicitly set to `false`).
    *   A custom link renderer (in `frontend/components/MarkdownRenderer.js`) *attempts* to sanitize the `href` attribute (but should be using DOMPurify).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive review of all `marked` extensions has not been performed. This is a critical gap.
    *   The image renderer does *not* sanitize the `src` or `alt` attributes. This is a potential XSS vulnerability.
    *   The custom link renderer should be updated to use DOMPurify for sanitization, rather than any custom sanitization logic.
    *   No custom `sanitizer` function is defined (which is correct for newer `marked` versions, but highlights the reliance on external sanitization).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates of `marked`](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_of__marked_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Updates of `marked`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Dependency Checks:** Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in `marked` during builds and deployments.  Configure these tools to fail the build if vulnerabilities are found.
    2.  **Scheduled Manual Checks:**  Even with automated checks, perform periodic manual checks for updates to `marked` on its GitHub repository or official website.
    3.  **Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to `marked` to receive timely notifications of vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Rapid Update Process:** Establish a clear and documented process for quickly updating `marked` to a patched version when a vulnerability is disclosed.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in `marked` (Severity: Variable - depends on the specific vulnerability):**  Staying up-to-date ensures you have the latest security patches, addressing known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** While you cannot prevent zero-day vulnerabilities, a rapid update process minimizes the window of exposure after a vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from Variable to Low (assuming prompt updates are applied).
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Impact is mitigated by reducing the time your application is vulnerable.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `npm audit` is run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal process or schedule for manual checks for `marked` updates.
    *   No subscriptions to security advisories specifically for `marked`.
    *   The update process for `marked` is not clearly documented and may not be rapid enough.
