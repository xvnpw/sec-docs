**High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving Marked.js:**

* **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into Markdown content that, when parsed and rendered by `marked.js`, execute in the user's browser.
    * **How Marked Contributes:** `marked.js` translates Markdown syntax into HTML. If not properly configured or if vulnerabilities exist within `marked.js` itself, malicious Markdown can be translated into executable JavaScript within the rendered HTML.
    * **Example:**
        * Markdown input: `[Click Me](javascript:alert('XSS'))`
        * Markdown input: `` `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` ``
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enable and properly configure the `sanitize` option in `marked.js`.** This is the primary defense against XSS by stripping potentially dangerous HTML.
        * **Keep `marked.js` updated to the latest version.** Newer versions often include security fixes for identified vulnerabilities in the parsing and rendering logic.
        * **Consider using a secondary HTML sanitizer after `marked.js` processing.** This provides an additional layer of defense against any bypasses in `marked.js`'s sanitization.
        * **Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).** This can restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating the impact of potential XSS even if `marked.js` fails to sanitize perfectly.

* **Attack Surface:** Configuration Vulnerabilities Leading to High or Critical Risk
    * **Description:** Incorrectly configuring `marked.js` options can weaken security and directly expose the application to high or critical vulnerabilities, primarily XSS.
    * **How Marked Contributes:** `marked.js` offers various configuration options (e.g., `sanitize`, custom renderers). Misconfiguring these options, particularly disabling `sanitize` or implementing insecure custom renderers, directly undermines the security provided by the library.
    * **Example:**
        * Disabling the `sanitize` option, allowing any HTML within Markdown to be rendered without filtering.
        * Implementing a custom renderer that doesn't properly escape user-provided data, leading to script injection.
    * **Impact:** Increased risk of XSS, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Thoroughly understand the purpose and security implications of each `marked.js` configuration option before deployment.**
        * **Ensure the `sanitize` option is enabled unless there is a very specific and well-justified reason to disable it, with alternative robust sanitization in place.**
        * **Exercise extreme caution when implementing custom renderers.** Ensure all user-provided data is properly escaped or sanitized within the renderer to prevent script injection.
        * **Regularly review and audit `marked.js` configuration settings to ensure they align with security best practices.**
        * **Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring `marked.js`. Only enable features and options that are absolutely necessary.**
