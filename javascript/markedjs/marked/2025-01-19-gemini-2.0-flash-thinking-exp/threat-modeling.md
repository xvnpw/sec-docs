# Threat Model Analysis for markedjs/marked

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markdown.md)

- **Description:** An attacker crafts Markdown input containing malicious JavaScript code embedded within elements like links, images, or raw HTML. When `marked.js` parses this input, it renders HTML that includes the attacker's script. This script then executes in the victim's browser when the rendered content is displayed, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, hijacking sessions, redirecting users, or defacing the page. This threat directly arises from `marked.js`'s core function of converting Markdown to HTML without sufficient built-in protection against malicious input.
- **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, defacement of the application, spreading malware.
- **Affected Component:** `marked.parse()` function, specifically the HTML rendering logic for various Markdown elements (links, images, raw HTML).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Utilize `marked.js`'s `options.sanitizer` function to remove or escape potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes.
    - Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
    - Employ a dedicated HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) *after* `marked.js` has rendered the HTML to further sanitize the output.
    - Carefully configure `marked.js`'s `options.breaks`, `options.gfm`, and `options.xhtml` to understand their implications on HTML output.

## Threat: [HTML Injection](./threats/html_injection.md)

- **Description:** An attacker injects arbitrary HTML code within the Markdown input. While this might not directly execute JavaScript if proper sanitization is in place, it can still manipulate the page's structure, appearance, or content. This can be used for phishing attacks by creating fake login forms, displaying misleading information, or breaking the page layout. This threat is directly related to how `marked.js` handles and renders HTML elements present in the Markdown input.
- **Impact:** Phishing attempts, defacement, user confusion, broken page layout, potential for social engineering attacks.
- **Affected Component:** `marked.parse()` function, specifically the rendering of HTML elements allowed by the parser.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust HTML sanitization after `marked.js` rendering to remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.
    - Carefully control which HTML elements and attributes are permitted in the rendered output based on the application's requirements.
    - Implement input validation on the Markdown content before processing to identify and reject suspicious patterns.

## Threat: [Bypass of Security Measures through Specific Markdown Syntax](./threats/bypass_of_security_measures_through_specific_markdown_syntax.md)

- **Description:** Attackers may discover specific, less common, or edge-case combinations of Markdown syntax that can bypass intended sanitization or filtering mechanisms within `marked.js` itself. This allows them to inject malicious HTML or scripts that would normally be blocked by the library's built-in protections or a configured sanitizer. This is a direct vulnerability within `marked.js`'s parsing and sanitization logic.
- **Impact:** Re-introduction of XSS or HTML injection vulnerabilities, undermining security controls.
- **Affected Component:** `marked.parse()` function, and potentially the `options.sanitizer` if it has limitations in handling specific syntax combinations.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Stay updated with the latest versions of `marked.js` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address known bypasses.
    - Conduct thorough testing with a wide range of potentially malicious Markdown input, including known bypass techniques and edge cases, specifically targeting `marked.js`'s parsing behavior.
    - If using a separate HTML sanitizer, ensure it is robust and actively maintained to handle a wide range of potential bypasses that might have slipped through `marked.js`.
