## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Marked.js](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_marked_js.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved a significant breach of the application's security, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized access, or disruption of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_markdown_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* This node represents the core attack surface related to `marked.js`. Attackers aim to craft malicious Markdown input that, when processed by `marked.js`, generates unintended and harmful output, primarily focusing on injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injection](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__injection.md)

* This critical node signifies the successful injection of malicious JavaScript code into the rendered HTML. If achieved, the attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser within the context of the application, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or performing actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Sanitization/Encoding](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_sanitizationencoding.md)

* This node is crucial for successful XSS. `marked.js` has built-in sanitization to prevent the rendering of potentially harmful HTML. Attackers focus on finding ways to circumvent or bypass this sanitization, allowing malicious scripts or HTML to be included in the final output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable Security Features](./attack_tree_paths/disable_security_features.md)

* This node represents a direct weakening of the application's security posture regarding `marked.js`. If an attacker can successfully disable security features like sanitization, it significantly increases the likelihood of successful XSS and HTML injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injection -> Bypass Sanitization/Encoding -> Inject Event Handlers (e.g., onerror, onload)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_markdown_parsing_vulnerabilities_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__injection_-_bypass_sanitizatio_9da78c8e.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft Markdown input that includes HTML tags with malicious event handlers (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="malicious_code()">`). If the sanitization in `marked.js` fails to remove or neutralize these event handlers, the browser will execute the JavaScript code within the event handler when the element is processed (e.g., when the image fails to load).
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Event handler injection is a common and often successful technique for bypassing basic sanitization.
* **Impact:** High - Successful execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injection -> Bypass Sanitization/Encoding -> Inject Javascript: URLs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_markdown_parsing_vulnerabilities_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__injection_-_bypass_sanitizatio_562ba81a.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers create Markdown links or image sources that use the `javascript:` protocol (e.g., `[Click Me](javascript:malicious_code())` or `<img src="javascript:malicious_code()">`). If `marked.js` does not properly sanitize or block these URLs, clicking the link or processing the image source will cause the browser to execute the JavaScript code embedded in the URL.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - While sanitization often targets `<script>` tags, `javascript:` URLs can sometimes be overlooked.
* **Impact:** High - Successful execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Options -> Disable Security Features -> Attacker Can Influence Configuration -> Disable Sanitization or other Security Measures](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_options_-_disable_security_features_-_attacker_can_influence_configuration_-_d_6c82b199.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path relies on the application allowing configuration of `marked.js` options and the attacker finding a way to influence these configurations. If successful, the attacker can disable crucial security features like sanitization. This effectively removes a significant barrier to XSS and HTML injection attacks, making it much easier to inject malicious content.
* **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - The likelihood depends heavily on the application's design and security measures around configuration management.
* **Impact:** High - Disabling sanitization opens the door for a wide range of client-side attacks, significantly increasing the application's vulnerability.
