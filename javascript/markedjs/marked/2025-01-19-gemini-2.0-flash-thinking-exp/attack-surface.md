# Attack Surface Analysis for markedjs/marked

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markdown.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code within Markdown content. When `marked.js` parses this content, it renders the malicious code, which then executes in the user's browser.

**How Marked Contributes:** `marked.js` by default renders HTML from Markdown. It doesn't inherently sanitize or escape potentially harmful HTML tags or JavaScript.

**Example:**
```markdown
This is some text. <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
```

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the user's session.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [HTML Injection Leading to UI Redress/Clickjacking](./attack_surfaces/html_injection_leading_to_ui_redressclickjacking.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject HTML structures that, while not directly executing scripts, can manipulate the application's UI. This can be used for UI redress attacks (overlaying legitimate UI elements with fake ones) or clickjacking (tricking users into clicking hidden elements).

**How Marked Contributes:** `marked.js` renders various HTML elements from Markdown, including `<div>`, `<span>`, and other structural tags that can be manipulated with CSS.

**Example:**
```markdown
<div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); z-index: 9999;">

</div>
```

**Impact:** Deceptive UI elements can trick users into performing unintended actions, revealing sensitive information, or clicking on malicious links.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Security Measures through Markdown Features](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_security_measures_through_markdown_features.md)

**Description:** Attackers leverage specific Markdown features (e.g., HTML entities, data URIs in images) to bypass input validation or sanitization measures implemented around the `marked.js` processing.

**How Marked Contributes:** `marked.js` correctly interprets and renders these features according to the Markdown specification.

**Example:**
```markdown
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" onerror="alert('Bypassed Sanitization')">
```

**Impact:** Circumventing security measures can lead to the injection of malicious content or the execution of unintended code.

**Risk Severity:** High
