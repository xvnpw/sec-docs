# Attack Surface Analysis for markedjs/marked

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Markdown Input Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_markdown_input_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts within Markdown content that, when parsed by `marked.js`, are rendered as executable JavaScript in the user's browser.
    *   **How Marked Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `marked.js` is responsible for parsing the Markdown input and converting it into HTML. If not configured securely or if its sanitization is bypassed, it can generate HTML containing the malicious scripts.
    *   **Example:** A user submits Markdown containing: `[Click me](javascript:alert('XSS'))` or raw HTML like `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`. If `marked.js` doesn't properly sanitize or escape these, the `alert('XSS')` will execute in the victim's browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful XSS can lead to account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, and defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Output Sanitization:**  Utilize `marked.js`'s built-in sanitization options and potentially integrate with a robust HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify) after `marked.js` processing.
        *   **Disable `mangle` Option (if not needed):** While primarily for obfuscation, ensure it doesn't inadvertently create bypasses.

## Attack Surface: [Bypass of Sanitization through Crafted Markdown](./attack_surfaces/bypass_of_sanitization_through_crafted_markdown.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers discover and exploit edge cases or vulnerabilities in `marked.js`'s parsing logic to craft Markdown that results in unsanitized or unexpected HTML output, bypassing intended sanitization measures.
    *   **How Marked Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The complexity of the Markdown specification and the potential for variations in parser implementations can create opportunities for crafting input that the sanitizer doesn't recognize as malicious.
    *   **Example:** Using nested or unusual combinations of Markdown syntax or HTML entities that, when parsed, produce exploitable HTML structures despite basic sanitization attempts.
    *   **Impact:**  Leads to XSS vulnerabilities, similar to direct script injection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep `marked.js` Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address known bypasses.
        *   **Thorough Testing with Security Scanners:** Use security testing tools and techniques (including fuzzing) to identify potential sanitization bypasses specific to the `marked.js` version in use.

## Attack Surface: [Generation of Insecure HTML Attributes](./attack_surfaces/generation_of_insecure_html_attributes.md)

*   **Description:** Even if `<script>` tags are blocked, `marked.js` might generate HTML with attributes (like `href`, `src`, or event handlers) that can be exploited for XSS if user-controlled data is incorporated into them.
    *   **How Marked Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `marked.js` transforms Markdown links and images into corresponding HTML elements with attributes. If the Markdown input contains malicious URLs or event handlers, `marked.js` might reproduce them in the HTML output.
    *   **Example:**  A user provides a Markdown link like `[Click me](javascript:void(0))` which, if not properly sanitized, will result in an `<a>` tag with a `javascript:` URL.
    *   **Impact:**  Leads to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Attribute Sanitization:**  Beyond just tag removal, ensure that HTML attributes generated by `marked.js` are also sanitized to remove potentially dangerous values (e.g., `javascript:` URLs).
        *   **Restrict Allowed URL Schemes:** Implement checks to ensure that URLs used in links and images adhere to a safe list of schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`, `mailto`).

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration Allowing Unsafe HTML](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_allowing_unsafe_html.md)

*   **Description:** Developers incorrectly configure `marked.js` to allow raw HTML input or disable its sanitization features, directly exposing the application to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Marked Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `marked.js` provides configuration options to control its behavior, including how it handles HTML. Misusing these options can weaken security.
    *   **Example:** Explicitly setting the `sanitizer` option to a weak or non-existent function.
    *   **Impact:**  Significant XSS vulnerabilities, potentially allowing full control of user sessions and data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Defaults and Configuration:**  Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Only enable features or allow HTML tags if absolutely necessary.
        *   **Developer Training and Awareness:** Educate developers about the security implications of `marked.js` configuration options.
