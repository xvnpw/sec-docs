## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Marked.js (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_marked_js__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Successful exploitation of any of the vulnerabilities within Marked.js, or related to its usage, leads to this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XSS Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xss_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* This path represents the direct injection of malicious scripts into the application through Marked.js.
* **Inject Malicious `<script>` Tags (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts Markdown input that, when processed by Marked.js, results in the generation of `<script>` tags in the HTML output. If Marked.js or the application fails to properly escape or sanitize these tags, the browser will execute the embedded JavaScript code.
    * **Example:**  Markdown input like `"<script>alert('XSS')</script>"` would be rendered as a live script tag in the browser.
* **Inject Malicious Event Handlers (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Similar to `<script>` tags, attackers can inject HTML elements with malicious event handlers (e.g., `onerror`, `onload`, `onmouseover`). When the event is triggered, the associated JavaScript code executes.
    * **Example:** Markdown input like `"<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>"` would create an image tag. Since the `src` is invalid, the `onerror` event fires, executing the JavaScript.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTML Injection Vulnerabilities (leading to further attacks) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_html_injection_vulnerabilities__leading_to_further_attacks___high-risk_path_.md)

* This path involves injecting arbitrary HTML into the application's pages via Marked.js. While not directly executing JavaScript, this injected HTML can be used for various malicious purposes.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Inject Malicious Links:** Injecting `<a>` tags with malicious `href` attributes can redirect users to phishing sites or sites hosting malware. Example: `"[Click here](https://malicious.example.com)"`.
    * **Inject Form Elements for Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can inject `<form>` elements to trick users into submitting sensitive information to a server controlled by the attacker. This involves crafting a form with input fields and a malicious submission URL.
    * **Inject Content that Disrupts Application Layout or Functionality:** Injecting large or complex HTML structures can break the application's layout, making it unusable or hiding legitimate content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Application Level, but related to Marked.js usage) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__application_level__but_related_to_marked_js_usage___high-risk_cb6f6393.md)

* This path highlights vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates and configures Marked.js, rather than flaws within Marked.js itself.
* **Misconfiguration of Marked.js Options (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Marked.js might offer configuration options to control sanitization or other security-related features. If these options are disabled or improperly configured, it can significantly increase the attack surface, making XSS and HTML injection easier.
    * **Example:** If a `sanitizer` option is available and disabled, malicious HTML will not be filtered.
* **Improper Handling of Marked.js Output (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The most common vulnerability in this category is displaying the raw HTML output generated by Marked.js directly in the browser without any further sanitization or escaping. This directly enables XSS and HTML injection attacks.
    * **Example:**  If the application simply renders the output of `marked(user_input)` without any processing, any malicious HTML within `user_input` will be executed by the browser.
