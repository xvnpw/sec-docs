# Threat Model Analysis for markedjs/marked

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML Injection](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_html_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious Markdown input, when processed by `marked.js`'s core parsing and rendering logic, is transformed into HTML containing executable JavaScript. This occurs because `marked.js`, by default or through specific configurations, might render certain Markdown syntax into HTML that allows for script execution (e.g., through `<img>` with `onerror`, `<svg>` with script tags, or direct `<script>` tags if enabled).
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or the execution of actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Component:** `marked.js` core parsing and rendering logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict HTML Sanitization:** Implement a robust HTML sanitizer library (e.g., DOMPurify) on the output of `marked.js` *before* inserting it into the DOM. Configure the sanitizer to aggressively remove potentially malicious HTML elements and attributes.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed and ideally disallow inline scripts (`'unsafe-inline'`).
        *   **Restrict Marked.js Options:** Carefully review and configure `marked.js` options to disable or restrict the rendering of HTML that can lead to XSS, such as disabling inline HTML rendering if it's not necessary.

## Threat: [Bypassing Application Security Measures via Unintended HTML Output](./threats/bypassing_application_security_measures_via_unintended_html_output.md)

*   **Description:** `marked.js`'s rendering logic might produce HTML elements or attributes that circumvent security filters or restrictions implemented by the application. For instance, if the application blocks `<iframe>` tags, `marked.js` could generate an equivalent using `<object>` or `<embed>` tags, or potentially through variations in attribute encoding or tag construction that the application's filters don't anticipate.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject potentially harmful content or functionality that the application intended to block, leading to various security vulnerabilities depending on the bypassed restriction, such as embedding external malicious content or triggering unintended behaviors.
    *   **Affected Component:** `marked.js` core rendering logic and its interpretation of Markdown syntax into HTML.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Comprehensive HTML Sanitization:** Employ a strict HTML sanitizer *after* `marked.js` processing, configured to be more restrictive than `marked.js`'s default output. Ensure the sanitizer is up-to-date with bypass techniques.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application, specifically focusing on how `marked.js`'s output interacts with other security mechanisms.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only enable the necessary features and HTML rendering options in `marked.js`. If certain HTML constructs are not required, disable them.
