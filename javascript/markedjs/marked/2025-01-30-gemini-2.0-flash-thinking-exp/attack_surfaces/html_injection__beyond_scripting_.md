### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: HTML Injection (Beyond Scripting)

#### 2.1 Detailed Description

HTML Injection (Beyond Scripting) is a vulnerability that arises when an application renders user-controlled input as HTML without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTML elements beyond just `<script>` tags. While preventing script execution is a crucial security measure, it's insufficient to fully mitigate the risks of HTML injection.  Many HTML tags and attributes, even without JavaScript, can be leveraged for malicious purposes.

This attack surface exploits the inherent capabilities of HTML to:

*   **Structure and Modify Content:** Injecting elements like `<div>`, `<span>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, etc., can alter the intended layout and content of the webpage. While seemingly less severe than script injection, this can be used for website defacement, content manipulation, and subtle phishing attempts.
*   **Embed External Resources:** Tags like `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<audio>/<video>` with `src` attributes can embed external content. This is a significant risk as it allows attackers to load content from malicious domains directly into the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **Manipulate User Interaction:** Tags like `<a>` with `href`, `<form>` with `action`, and even attributes like `style` and `class` can be manipulated to redirect users, create deceptive links, or alter the visual presentation to facilitate phishing or clickjacking attacks.
*   **Introduce Meta-Information:** Tags like `<meta>` and `<base>` (though less commonly rendered from Markdown by default) can potentially alter the document's behavior, such as setting a new base URL for relative links, which can be exploited in certain scenarios.

The danger lies in the fact that users often perceive content rendered by the application as trustworthy.  If malicious HTML is injected and rendered, it can seamlessly blend into the legitimate content, making it harder for users to distinguish between safe and malicious elements.

#### 2.2 How marked.js Contributes to the Attack Surface

`marked.js` is designed to parse Markdown syntax and convert it into HTML. By default, `marked.js` is quite permissive in the HTML tags it renders.  It aims to provide a comprehensive Markdown-to-HTML conversion, which inherently includes rendering a wide range of HTML elements that are valid within Markdown syntax.

Specifically, `marked.js` will, by default, render HTML tags embedded directly within Markdown.  This means if a user inputs Markdown containing HTML tags like `<iframe>`, `<a>`, `<div>`, etc., `marked.js` will faithfully translate these into their corresponding HTML elements in the output.

**Example Breakdown (Iframe Injection):**

The provided example of iframe injection clearly illustrates this:

*   **Markdown Input:** `` `<iframe src="https://malicious-phishing-site.com" width="800" height="600"></iframe>` ``
*   `marked.js` parses this Markdown. It recognizes the HTML tag `<iframe>` and its attributes.
*   **Rendered HTML:** `marked.js` generates the exact HTML: `` `<iframe src="https://malicious-phishing-site.com" width="800" height="600"></iframe>` ``
*   **Browser Interpretation:** The browser renders this HTML, creating an iframe that loads the content from `https://malicious-phishing-site.com` within the application's page.

**Why this is problematic with `marked.js`:**

*   **Default Permissiveness:**  Out-of-the-box, `marked.js` does not sanitize or filter HTML tags. It prioritizes accurate Markdown rendering over security by default.
*   **Markdown's HTML Support:** Markdown specification allows for embedding raw HTML, which `marked.js` is designed to handle. This feature, while useful for advanced Markdown usage, becomes a security liability when user input is involved.
*   **Client-Side Rendering:** `marked.js` is primarily a client-side JavaScript library.  If sanitization is not implemented correctly *before* rendering on the client-side, the browser will directly execute the potentially malicious HTML.

#### 2.3 Expanded Impact Assessment

The impact of successful HTML Injection (Beyond Scripting) can be significant and goes beyond simple website defacement.  Here's a more comprehensive breakdown:

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Injecting iframes or crafting deceptive links (`<a>` tags with malicious `href`) can redirect users to attacker-controlled phishing sites designed to steal credentials, personal information, or financial details. The injected content appears within the trusted context of the legitimate application, increasing the likelihood of user deception.
*   **Clickjacking:**  Attackers can use techniques like layering iframes or manipulating CSS (through injected `style` attributes or classes) to create invisible or misleading layers over legitimate UI elements. This can trick users into performing unintended actions, such as clicking on malicious links or buttons hidden beneath seemingly harmless elements.
*   **Website Defacement and Content Manipulation:** Injecting arbitrary HTML can completely alter the visual appearance of the webpage, displaying misleading information, propaganda, or offensive content. Even subtle modifications can damage the application's reputation and user trust.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Websites:**  Beyond iframes, `<a>` tags can be injected to redirect users to malware distribution sites, exploit kits, or other harmful online locations.
*   **Data Theft (Indirect):** While not direct data exfiltration, injected forms (`<form>`) within iframes or manipulated links can be used to collect user input and send it to attacker-controlled servers. This can be used to steal form data, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
*   **Malware Distribution (Indirect):**  By embedding iframes or links to attacker-controlled websites, the vulnerable application can become a vector for malware distribution. Users visiting the compromised page might be exposed to drive-by downloads or other malware delivery mechanisms hosted on the linked malicious sites.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Indirect (in some scenarios):** While we are focusing on "beyond scripting," HTML injection can sometimes *facilitate* XSS. For example, injecting attributes that trigger client-side framework vulnerabilities or bypass certain XSS filters could indirectly lead to script execution.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful HTML injection attack can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it. Users may lose trust in the platform, leading to decreased usage and potential financial losses.
*   **SEO Poisoning:**  Injecting hidden or misleading content can negatively impact the application's search engine optimization (SEO) ranking, making it harder for legitimate users to find the application.

**Risk Severity: High** -  The risk severity remains **High** due to the ease of exploitation (simply injecting HTML in Markdown input), the wide range of potential impacts (from phishing to malware distribution), and the likelihood of occurrence if proper mitigation strategies are not implemented.  The potential for widespread user harm and significant damage to the application justifies this high-risk classification.

#### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies - Deep Dive and Expansion

To effectively mitigate the HTML Injection (Beyond Scripting) attack surface when using `marked.js`, a multi-layered approach is recommended.

##### 2.4.1 Strict Whitelist-Based Sanitization

*   **Implementation:** This is the most crucial mitigation.  Instead of trying to blacklist dangerous tags (which is prone to bypasses), adopt a strict whitelist approach. This means explicitly defining the *only* HTML tags and attributes that are allowed to be rendered from Markdown. **Deny everything by default and explicitly allow only what is necessary.**
*   **Tools and Libraries:**
    *   **`DOMPurify`:**  A highly recommended, widely used, and well-maintained JavaScript library specifically designed for HTML sanitization. It uses a robust whitelist approach and is effective against various HTML injection attacks. Integrate `DOMPurify` with `marked.js`.  After `marked.js` renders the HTML, pass the output through `DOMPurify` for sanitization *before* displaying it on the page.
    *   **`sanitize-html`:** Another popular JavaScript library for HTML sanitization, offering similar functionality to `DOMPurify`.
    *   **Configuration:**  When using a sanitization library, configure it with a strict whitelist.  For example, if you only need basic text formatting, allow tags like:
        *   `p`, `br`, `hr`
        *   `em`, `strong`, `u`, `s`
        *   `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`
        *   `ul`, `ol`, `li`
        *   `blockquote`, `pre`, `code`
        *   `a` (with carefully controlled `rel` and `href` attributes - see below)
        *   `img` (with carefully controlled `src`, `alt`, and potentially `title` attributes - see below)
    *   **Attribute Whitelisting:**  Crucially, whitelist attributes as well. For example, for `<a>` tags, you might only allow `href`, `title`, and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. For `<img>` tags, allow `src`, `alt`, and `title`.  **Avoid allowing `style`, `class`, `id`, or event handler attributes (e.g., `onclick`, `onload`) unless absolutely necessary and extremely carefully controlled.**
    *   **Example Integration (Conceptual with `DOMPurify`):**

        ```javascript
        import * as marked from 'marked';
        import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

        const markdownInput = document.getElementById('markdown-input').value;
        const rawHTML = marked.parse(markdownInput);
        const sanitizedHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(rawHTML, {
            ALLOWED_TAGS: ['p', 'br', 'strong', 'em', 'a', 'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'blockquote', 'pre', 'code', 'img'],
            ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href', 'rel', 'title', 'src', 'alt'],
            // Further customization of DOMPurify configuration as needed
        });
        document.getElementById('output-div').innerHTML = sanitizedHTML;
        ```

##### 2.4.2 Remove Potentially Dangerous Tags (Explicitly)

*   **Targeted Removal:** Even with a whitelist, it's beneficial to explicitly remove or neutralize certain highly dangerous tags, especially if they are not essential for your application's Markdown functionality.
*   **Tags to Remove/Neutralize:**
    *   **`iframe`:**  Almost always dangerous in user-generated content contexts. Remove it entirely.
    *   **`object`, `embed`, `applet`:**  Tags used for embedding external executable content. Remove them.
    *   **`form`, `base`, `meta`:**  Tags that can significantly alter the document's behavior or context. Remove them unless there's a very specific and controlled use case.
    *   **`script`:** While focusing on "beyond scripting," explicitly ensure `<script>` tags are always removed or neutralized.
    *   **Event Handler Attributes:**  Attributes like `onclick`, `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`, etc., should be stripped from all tags during sanitization.
*   **Implementation:** Sanitization libraries like `DOMPurify` and `sanitize-html` can be configured to remove specific tags.  Alternatively, you could implement custom logic to parse the HTML output from `marked.js` and remove these tags before rendering. However, using a dedicated sanitization library is generally more robust and less error-prone.

##### 2.4.3 Content Security Policy (CSP)

*   **Defense-in-Depth:** CSP is a browser-level security mechanism that acts as a crucial defense-in-depth layer against HTML injection and other content-related attacks. It allows you to define policies that control the resources the browser is allowed to load for your application.
*   **Relevant CSP Directives:**
    *   **`default-src 'self'`:**  Sets the default source for all resource types to be the application's own origin. This is a good starting point for a restrictive CSP.
    *   **`script-src 'self'`:**  Restricts the sources from which JavaScript can be loaded.  Crucial for preventing script injection, but also relevant as part of a broader security posture against HTML injection.
    *   **`frame-src 'none'` or `frame-src 'self'` (or specific whitelisted origins):**  Controls the sources from which iframes can be loaded.  Setting `frame-src 'none'` completely disables iframes, which is a strong mitigation against iframe injection. If you need iframes, whitelist only trusted origins.
    *   **`object-src 'none'`:**  Restricts the sources for `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` tags. Set to `'none'` to prevent loading external plugins.
    *   **`style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (or ideally `'self' 'nonce-'...`):** Controls the sources of stylesheets. While less directly related to the core HTML injection problem discussed here, it's part of a comprehensive CSP.  Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` if possible and use nonces or hashes for inline styles.
    *   **`img-src 'self' data:` (or specific whitelisted origins):** Controls image sources.  Whitelist trusted origins and consider allowing `data:` URLs for inline images if needed, but be cautious.
*   **Implementation:** Configure your web server to send the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header with appropriate directives.  Test your CSP thoroughly to ensure it doesn't break legitimate application functionality while effectively restricting malicious content.
*   **Reporting:**  Consider using the `report-uri` or `report-to` CSP directives to receive reports of policy violations. This helps you monitor and refine your CSP over time.

##### 2.4.4 Input Validation (Markdown Level - Less Direct but Helpful)

*   **Limited Effectiveness for HTML Injection:** While input validation on the Markdown itself is less directly effective against *rendered HTML* injection (as `marked.js` will still process valid Markdown containing HTML), it can be helpful in certain scenarios.
*   **Purpose:**  Input validation at the Markdown level can help:
    *   **Prevent accidental or unintentional HTML:**  If users are not supposed to use raw HTML in Markdown, you can implement checks to flag or remove HTML-like syntax in the input Markdown before it's even processed by `marked.js`.
    *   **Enforce Markdown Syntax Rules:**  Ensure the Markdown input adheres to expected formatting and structure, which can indirectly reduce the likelihood of unexpected HTML injection attempts.
*   **Implementation:**  You could use regular expressions or a Markdown parser to analyze the input Markdown string before passing it to `marked.js`.  However, be aware that this is not a substitute for HTML sanitization of the *rendered output*.

##### 2.4.5 Regular Security Audits and Testing

*   **Ongoing Process:** Security is not a one-time fix. Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including HTML injection issues.
*   **Testing Scenarios:**  Specifically test with various Markdown inputs containing different HTML tags and attributes to ensure your sanitization and CSP are working as expected.
*   **Keep Libraries Updated:**  Ensure `marked.js` and any sanitization libraries you use are kept up-to-date to benefit from security patches and improvements.

### 3. Conclusion and Best Practices

HTML Injection (Beyond Scripting) is a significant attack surface in applications using `marked.js` due to the library's default permissive HTML rendering.  While preventing script execution is important, it's insufficient to fully mitigate the risks. Attackers can leverage various HTML tags and attributes for phishing, clickjacking, website defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Best Practices for Mitigation:**

1.  **Prioritize Strict Whitelist-Based Sanitization:**  Use a robust HTML sanitization library like `DOMPurify` or `sanitize-html` *after* `marked.js` rendering and *before* displaying the HTML. Configure it with a strict whitelist of allowed tags and attributes. **Deny by default.**
2.  **Explicitly Remove Dangerous Tags:**  Even with a whitelist, explicitly remove or neutralize highly risky tags like `iframe`, `object`, `embed`, `form`, `base`, and `meta`.
3.  **Implement a Strong Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use CSP as a defense-in-depth mechanism to restrict resource loading, especially for frames, scripts, and objects.
4.  **Attribute Whitelisting is Crucial:**  Carefully whitelist allowed attributes for each allowed tag. Avoid allowing `style`, `class`, `id`, and event handler attributes unless absolutely necessary and rigorously controlled.
5.  **Regularly Audit and Test:**  Conduct security audits and penetration testing to verify the effectiveness of your mitigation strategies and identify any new vulnerabilities.
6.  **Keep Libraries Updated:**  Maintain up-to-date versions of `marked.js` and sanitization libraries.

By implementing these comprehensive mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of HTML Injection (Beyond Scripting) vulnerabilities in applications using `marked.js` and protect their users from potential attacks.
