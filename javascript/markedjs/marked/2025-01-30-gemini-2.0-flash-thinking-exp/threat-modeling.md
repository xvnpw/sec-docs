# Threat Model Analysis for markedjs/marked

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown Input](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markdown_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious markdown input containing JavaScript code disguised within HTML tags or attributes that `marked` parses and renders as executable code in the user's browser. For example, injecting `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` or using javascript: URLs in links. The attacker might inject this markdown into user-generated content, comments, or any input processed by `marked`. When a victim views this content, the injected script executes, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting to malicious sites, or defacing the page.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful XSS can lead to complete compromise of the user's session and account, data theft, malware distribution, and website defacement.
*   **Affected Marked Component:** HTML Renderer, Link Handling, Image Handling (specifically when parsing and rendering HTML tags and attributes within markdown).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict HTML Sanitization:**  Utilize a robust HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify) *after* `marked` parsing but *before* rendering the HTML in the browser. Configure the sanitizer to remove or neutralize potentially dangerous HTML elements and attributes (e.g., `script`, `iframe`, `onerror`, `onload`, `javascript:` URLs).
    *   **Configure `marked` with `sanitizer` Option:** Leverage `marked`'s built-in `sanitizer` option to provide a custom sanitization function. This allows for fine-grained control over the HTML output.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts. This acts as a defense-in-depth measure even if sanitization is bypassed.
    *   **Regularly Update `marked`:** Keep `marked` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes that may address XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation (Pre-parsing):**  While less effective against sophisticated XSS, consider basic input validation on the markdown content itself to reject obviously malicious patterns before passing it to `marked`.
