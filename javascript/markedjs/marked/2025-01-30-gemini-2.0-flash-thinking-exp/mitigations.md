# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for markedjs/marked

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Sanitization with `marked`](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_sanitization_with__marked_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Sanitization with `marked`
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Sanitization Approach:** Decide between using `marked`'s built-in `sanitizer` option or integrating a dedicated HTML sanitization library *to be used with* `marked`. Dedicated libraries are generally recommended for more robust protection and are configured within `marked`'s options.
    2.  **Implement Custom `marked` Sanitizer (if using `marked`'s option):** Define a JavaScript function and configure it as the `sanitizer` option within `marked.use({})`. This function will receive the raw HTML output from `marked` and must return sanitized HTML. The sanitizer should:
        *   Remove or escape potentially harmful HTML tags such as `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<style>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`, etc.
        *   Remove or escape dangerous HTML attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`, `href` (for `javascript:` URLs), `src` (for potentially malicious URLs), etc.
        *   Whitelist allowed tags and attributes only if absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    3.  **Integrate Sanitization Library with `marked` (if using a dedicated library):**
        *   Install the chosen library (e.g., `npm install dompurify`).
        *   Import the library.
        *   Configure `marked` to use the library's sanitization function as its `sanitizer` option within `marked.use({})`. For example, with DOMPurify:
            ```javascript
            const marked = require('marked');
            const DOMPurify = require('dompurify');

            marked.use({
                sanitizer: (html) => DOMPurify.sanitize(html)
            });
            ```
        *   Configure the sanitization library itself for stricter rules if needed, ensuring it's applied *via* `marked`'s `sanitizer` option.
    4.  **Apply Sanitization via `marked`:** Ensure the chosen sanitization method is correctly configured within `marked` so that it is applied to the HTML output *after* `marked` parses the markdown and *before* the output is used in the application.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Sanitizer:** Keep your `marked` sanitizer function or integrated library configuration updated, especially as new XSS vectors are discovered. Test your sanitization regularly with known XSS payloads *in the context of `marked` processing*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Prevents injection of malicious JavaScript code into the application *through markdown processed by `marked`*, protecting users from account compromise, data theft, and website defacement.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - High:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks originating from markdown input processed by `marked` by removing or neutralizing malicious HTML and JavaScript within the `marked` output.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic `marked` sanitizer is implemented in the frontend comment section to remove `<script>` tags, configured directly within the `marked` processing for comments.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More comprehensive sanitization using a dedicated library like DOMPurify integrated with `marked` is missing across the entire application, including:
        *   Backend markdown processing for blog posts and articles using `marked`.
        *   Admin panel markdown input for content management processed by `marked`.
        *   User profile descriptions that allow markdown processed by `marked`.
        *   Any other areas where markdown input from users or less trusted sources is processed by `marked`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update `marked` Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update__marked__library.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update `marked` Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor `marked` Releases:** Regularly check for new releases of `markedjs/marked` on GitHub or npm. Pay attention to security advisories and release notes specifically mentioning security fixes in `marked`.
    2.  **Review `marked` Release Notes for Security:** When updates are available, carefully review the release notes to identify security patches, bug fixes, and especially any mentions of XSS or ReDoS vulnerabilities addressed in `marked`.
    3.  **Update `marked` Dependency:** Use your package manager (e.g., npm, yarn) to update the `marked` dependency in your project to the latest version. This directly updates the `marked` library used in your application.
    4.  **Test Application with Updated `marked`:** After updating `marked`, thoroughly test your application, focusing on areas that use `marked` to ensure the update hasn't introduced regressions or broken functionality related to markdown rendering.
    5.  **Automate `marked` Updates (Consider):** Explore using dependency update tools (e.g., Dependabot, Renovate) to automate the process of checking for and proposing updates specifically for `marked` and other dependencies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Variable Severity:**  Addresses potential XSS vulnerabilities that might be discovered and patched *within the `marked` library itself*. Severity depends on the specific vulnerability patched in `marked`.
    *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) - Variable Severity:** Addresses potential ReDoS vulnerabilities that might be fixed *within `marked`'s regular expressions*. Severity depends on the specific ReDoS vulnerability in `marked`.
    *   **Other `marked` Parser Bugs - Variable Severity:** Fixes general bugs and potential security issues *within the `marked` parser*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Variable:**  Can significantly reduce XSS risk if the update patches an XSS vulnerability *in `marked`*.
    *   **ReDoS - Variable:** Can significantly reduce ReDoS risk if the update patches a ReDoS vulnerability *in `marked`*.
    *   **Other `marked` Parser Bugs - Variable:** Improves overall security and stability of markdown processing by addressing bugs *in `marked`*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `marked` dependency is manually updated approximately every 6 months.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated dependency update monitoring and alerts specifically for `marked` are not implemented.
    *   Updates of `marked` are not performed frequently enough. Aim for more frequent checks and updates, ideally monthly or even more often for security-sensitive libraries like `marked`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for `marked` Features](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for__marked__features.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for `marked` Features
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `marked` Features and Extensions:** Identify all `marked` features and extensions that are currently enabled or potentially enabled in your application's `marked` configuration. This includes core features and any extensions you might be using (e.g., GFM tables, task lists, breaks, etc.).
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** For each feature and extension, evaluate if it is truly necessary for your application's functionality. If a feature or extension is not actively used or provides only marginal benefit, disable it in your `marked` configuration.  This reduces the complexity of the `marked` parser.
    3.  **Configure `marked.use({})` for Minimal Features:**  Explicitly configure `marked.use({})` to only enable the features and extensions that are absolutely required. For example, if you don't need GFM tables, ensure they are not enabled.
    4.  **Regularly Re-evaluate Feature Usage:** Periodically review your application's markdown processing requirements and re-evaluate if all enabled `marked` features are still necessary. Disable any features that are no longer needed to maintain a minimal configuration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Low Severity (Indirect):** Reducing parser complexity *in `marked`* can potentially reduce the attack surface and the likelihood of undiscovered XSS vulnerabilities within less commonly used features.
    *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) - Low Severity (Indirect):**  Disabling complex features *in `marked`* might indirectly reduce the risk of ReDoS vulnerabilities associated with those specific features' regular expressions.
    *   **General Parser Bugs - Low Severity (Indirect):**  Simplifying the parser configuration *of `marked`* can potentially reduce the overall risk of encountering bugs in less used features.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Low:**  Marginally reduces XSS risk by simplifying the `marked` parser.
    *   **ReDoS - Low:** Marginally reduces ReDoS risk by simplifying the `marked` parser.
    *   **General Parser Bugs - Low:** Marginally improves stability by using a less complex `marked` configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Default `marked` configuration is used, which enables a set of core features. No explicit disabling of features is currently done.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A review of enabled `marked` features and extensions is needed to identify and disable any unnecessary ones.
    *   Explicit configuration of `marked.use({})` to enable only required features should be implemented.
    *   This configuration should be applied consistently across all areas where `marked` is used.
