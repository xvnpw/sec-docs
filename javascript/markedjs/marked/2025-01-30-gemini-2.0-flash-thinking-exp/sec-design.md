# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `markedjs/marked`, is a Javascript library for parsing Markdown into HTML.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a fast and accurate Markdown parsing library for Javascript environments.
  - Ensure broad compatibility across different Javascript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc.).
  - Maintainability and extensibility to adapt to evolving Markdown standards and user needs.
  - Security, ensuring the library does not introduce vulnerabilities when processing user-supplied Markdown.
  - Community adoption and active maintenance to ensure long-term viability.

- Business Risks:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the parser incorrectly handles malicious Markdown input, allowing execution of arbitrary Javascript in user browsers. This is the most critical risk for a Markdown parser.
  - Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities if specially crafted Markdown input can cause excessive resource consumption, making applications using `markedjs/marked` unresponsive.
  - Data breaches if `markedjs/marked` is used in server-side applications and vulnerabilities allow attackers to access sensitive data or gain unauthorized access.
  - Supply chain attacks if dependencies of `markedjs/marked` are compromised, potentially injecting malicious code into applications using the library.
  - Lack of maintenance and community support leading to stagnation and unaddressed security vulnerabilities over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Github repository with version control and issue tracking (https://github.com/markedjs/marked).
  - security control: Open source project with community contributions and peer review (https://github.com/markedjs/marked).
  - security control: Unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and potentially catch some basic input validation issues (inferred from standard software development practices).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching, which can be slower than dedicated security teams.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not actively monitored or patched.
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or code audits specifically focused on security vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Introduce fuzz testing to proactively discover input validation vulnerabilities by feeding the parser with a large volume of potentially malicious Markdown inputs.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security code reviews by security experts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle reported security issues effectively.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a Javascript library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using `markedjs/marked`.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a Javascript library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using `markedjs/marked`.
  - Input Validation: Critical. `markedjs/marked` must rigorously validate and sanitize Markdown input to prevent injection attacks, especially XSS. This includes:
    - Encoding HTML entities properly.
    - Sanitizing or removing potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes.
    - Handling edge cases and unexpected input formats robustly.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of a Markdown parser. Cryptography might be relevant if features like encrypted Markdown extensions were to be added in the future, but not for the current scope.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Parsing Markdown text accurately and reliably.
  - Preventing security vulnerabilities, especially XSS, in the parsed HTML output.
  - Maintaining the library's functionality and security over time.
  - Ensuring availability and accessibility of the library through package registries.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Markdown Input: Sensitivity depends on the context of use. If processing user-generated content, it can be considered sensitive as it might contain personal or confidential information. The primary concern is not data confidentiality of the Markdown itself, but rather preventing malicious Markdown from causing harm.
  - HTML Output:  Sensitivity is derived from the Markdown input. If the Markdown input is sensitive, the HTML output might also be considered sensitive. However, the main security concern with HTML output is integrity and preventing injection vulnerabilities.
  - Source Code: Sensitive as it represents the intellectual property and contains the logic of the `markedjs/marked` library. Confidentiality and integrity of the source code are important to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosure.
  - Build Artifacts (JS Library Package): Sensitive in terms of integrity. Malicious modification of the published package could have widespread impact on applications using `markedjs/marked`.
