### High and Critical React-Specific Threats

This list outlines high and critical security threats that directly involve the React library.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application by providing unsanitized user input that is then rendered using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop provided by React. The attacker might execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to a malicious website. This directly involves the React API for rendering raw HTML.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected React Component:**  Any component utilizing the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop provided by React.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` whenever possible.** This React prop bypasses React's built-in sanitization.
        *   If its use is unavoidable, **thoroughly sanitize the input** using a trusted and well-maintained sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) *before* passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
        *   Implement **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to further mitigate XSS risks.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** In applications using SSR with React, if user-provided data is not properly sanitized on the server before being rendered into the initial HTML generated by React's rendering process, an attacker can inject malicious scripts. These scripts will execute as soon as the page loads in the user's browser. This directly involves how React renders components on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected React Component:** Components rendered on the server during the SSR process using React's rendering mechanisms, particularly those displaying user-generated content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize all user-provided data on the server-side** before rendering it using React.
        *   Utilize templating engines or libraries that provide automatic escaping of output within the React rendering pipeline.
        *   Implement **Content Security Policy (CSP)**.

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution via Props or State
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate props or state passed to React components in a way that pollutes the JavaScript object prototype. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities in other parts of the application or even other libraries by modifying the behavior of built-in JavaScript objects. The attacker might achieve this by exploiting vulnerabilities in data handling within React components or by controlling input that is used to create or modify objects managed by React's state mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**  Unexpected application behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution if the polluted prototype is used in a vulnerable way by other code.
    *   **Affected React Component:** Any component that receives and processes props or manages state using React's `useState`, `useReducer`, or class component state mechanisms, especially when dealing with external or user-controlled data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization** for all data received through props and state within React components.
        *   **Freeze or seal objects** where possible to prevent modification within React component logic.
        *   Be cautious when **merging or spreading objects** within React components, especially those originating from external sources.
        *   Regularly **audit dependencies** for potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities that could affect data passed to React components.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Client-Side State
    *   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, personal data) directly in the React component's state (using `useState`, `useReducer`, or class component state) or in a client-side state management solution (like Redux or Context) without proper protection. An attacker with access to the browser's developer tools or through other client-side attacks could easily access this data directly from React's state management.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for further attacks using the exposed credentials or data.
    *   **Affected React Component:** Any component managing sensitive data in its state using React's state management features or connected to a state management solution holding sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid storing sensitive data directly in the client-side state managed by React.**
        *   Fetch sensitive data only when needed and process it securely, minimizing its presence in React's state.
        *   If persistent client-side storage is necessary, **use secure mechanisms like HTTP-only cookies or the browser's `localStorage` with appropriate encryption** for non-sensitive data, and avoid storing sensitive data in React's state.
        *   Implement proper **access control mechanisms** on the backend to limit data exposure, regardless of client-side state.
