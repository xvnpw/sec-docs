# Threat Model Analysis for d3/d3

## Threat: [XSS via Malicious Data Injection into DOM Manipulation](./threats/xss_via_malicious_data_injection_into_dom_manipulation.md)

**Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through DOM Manipulation
* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code or HTML within data provided to the application. When d3.js uses functions like `selection.html()` or `selection.append()` with this unsanitized data, the malicious code is directly inserted into the DOM and executed in the user's browser. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
* **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session and potential for data theft, website defacement, and further attacks.
* **Affected d3 component:**
    * `d3-selection` module, specifically functions like:
        * `selection.html()`
        * `selection.append()`
        * `selection.insert()`
        * `selection.property()` (when setting properties that can execute JavaScript, like `onerror`)
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Data Sanitization:** Sanitize all external data *before* using it with d3.js DOM manipulation functions. Use a robust HTML sanitization library to remove or escape potentially malicious code.
    * **Use `selection.text()` for Text Content:** When setting text content, prefer `selection.text()` over `selection.html()`. `selection.text()` automatically escapes HTML entities, preventing XSS.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict inline JavaScript and control resource loading sources, limiting the impact of XSS.
    * **Input Validation:** Validate data inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and types, reducing the likelihood of unexpected malicious payloads.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Unintended Visualization Details](./threats/data_leakage_through_unintended_visualization_details.md)

**Threat:** Information Disclosure via Visualization
* **Description:**  A visualization created with d3.js unintentionally reveals sensitive or confidential information due to insufficient data masking, anonymization, or access controls. This could occur through displaying raw data, revealing patterns that infer sensitive information, or providing overly detailed visualizations to unauthorized users.
* **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive data, potentially leading to privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance, or reputational damage.
* **Affected d3 component:**
    * All d3 modules involved in data representation and visual encoding, including:
        * `d3-scale` module (data mapping to visual attributes)
        * `d3-shape` module (shape generation representing data)
        * `d3-axis` module (axis labels and ticks displaying data values)
        * `d3-format` module (data formatting for display)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Data Masking and Anonymization:** Apply appropriate data masking, anonymization, or aggregation techniques to sensitive data *before* visualization.
    * **Access Control and Authorization:** Implement robust access control to ensure only authorized users can view visualizations containing potentially sensitive information.
    * **Visualization Review for Data Sensitivity:** Review visualizations to ensure they do not inadvertently expose sensitive information. Consider the level of detail required and whether aggregation or abstraction is necessary.
    * **Contextual Awareness:** Be mindful of the context in which visualizations are presented and ensure the surrounding application does not inadvertently reveal sensitive information.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability in d3.js Library](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_in_d3_js_library.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerability in d3.js Dependency
* **Description:** A security vulnerability is discovered in the d3.js library itself or in one of its dependencies. If the application uses a vulnerable version of d3.js, it becomes susceptible to exploitation. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to perform various malicious actions, depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution.
* **Impact:** Variable, potentially Critical - Impact depends on the specific vulnerability. Could range to remote code execution, leading to full system compromise.
* **Affected d3 component:**
    * Entire d3.js library and its dependencies.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, yarn) to track and manage d3.js and its dependencies.
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep d3.js and all dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan application dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
    * **Security Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases to be notified of any reported vulnerabilities in d3.js or its ecosystem.
