# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is focused on utilizing the d3.js library, an open-source JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data, to create interactive data visualizations within web applications. The primary business goal is to enhance user interfaces and data presentation by leveraging dynamic and visually compelling graphics generated by d3.js. This can lead to improved user engagement, better data comprehension, and more effective communication of insights derived from data.

Key business priorities include:
- Enhancing user experience through interactive and informative data visualizations.
- Improving data-driven decision-making by making complex data more accessible and understandable.
- Creating visually appealing and modern web applications.
- Leveraging a widely adopted and mature open-source library to reduce development time and cost.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of vulnerabilities within the d3.js library itself, which could be exploited in applications using it.
- Risk of improper usage of d3.js leading to security vulnerabilities in the application, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if user-provided data is not handled correctly during visualization.
- Risk of supply chain attacks targeting the d3.js library or its dependencies.
- Risk of application downtime or malfunction due to issues within the d3.js library or its integration.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code review process within the d3.js open-source project (described in project's development practices).
- security control: Unit and integration testing within the d3.js project (described in project's testing infrastructure).
- security control: Reliance on browser security features for client-side execution environment (inherent to web browser environment).
- accepted risk:  Dependence on an external open-source library introduces inherent supply chain risks.
- accepted risk:  Potential for vulnerabilities to be discovered in d3.js after deployment.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in projects using d3.js to monitor for known vulnerabilities in d3.js and its dependencies.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security testing, including static and dynamic analysis, of applications that incorporate d3.js visualizations.
- recommended security control: Establish a process for promptly updating d3.js to the latest versions to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in web applications using d3.js to mitigate potential XSS risks.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to d3.js library itself. Authentication is a requirement for the web applications that will use d3.js to visualize data, to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive visualizations.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to d3.js library itself. Authorization is a requirement for the web applications that will use d3.js, to control access to specific visualizations based on user roles and permissions.
- Input validation: Crucial for applications using d3.js. All data used for visualization, especially if sourced from user input or external systems, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This validation should happen before data is passed to d3.js for rendering.
- Cryptography:  While d3.js itself does not directly handle cryptography, applications using d3.js might need to visualize encrypted data. In such cases, decryption should occur before data is passed to d3.js for visualization, and secure handling of decryption keys is paramount. If sensitive data is visualized, ensure data is transmitted and stored securely, potentially using encryption in transit (HTTPS) and encryption at rest.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write and modify the d3.js library code.
2. Version Control System (e.g., GitHub): Code changes are committed and pushed to a version control system, triggering the build process.
3. CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions): An automated CI/CD pipeline is triggered by code changes.
4. Build Server: The CI/CD pipeline uses a build server to fetch the latest code from the version control system and perform the build process. This includes tasks like compiling, minifying, and bundling JavaScript files.
5. Security Scan Tools: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools and linters are integrated into the build pipeline to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
6. Artifact Repository/CDN: Upon successful build and security checks, the build artifacts (minified d3.js files, distribution packages) are published to an artifact repository or directly to a CDN for distribution.

Build Security Controls:
- security control: Automated build process using CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent and repeatable builds.
- security control: Integration of SAST tools and linters in the build pipeline to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Dependency scanning during the build process to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- security control: Code review process before merging code changes to the main branch to ensure code quality and security.
- security control: Secure build environment to protect the build process and artifacts from tampering.
- security control: Signing of build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- For the d3.js library itself as an open-source project: Maintaining the integrity and availability of the library for the community. Preventing malicious modifications or supply chain attacks that could compromise users of the library.
- For applications using d3.js: Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the web applications and the data they visualize. Ensuring accurate and reliable data visualization for informed decision-making. Maintaining user trust and preventing security incidents that could damage reputation.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- For the d3.js library itself: Primarily the source code of the library. Its sensitivity is high in terms of maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the open-source project.
- For applications using d3.js: The data being visualized. The sensitivity of this data varies greatly depending on the application. It could range from public data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. The sensitivity level dictates the required security controls for data handling, storage, and transmission within the application and the visualization process.
