# Threat Model Analysis for d3/d3

## Threat: [XSS via Unsafe HTML Injection with `.html()`](./threats/xss_via_unsafe_html_injection_with___html___.md)

*   **Threat:**  XSS via Unsafe HTML Injection with `.html()`

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application by providing input that is directly used within D3's `.html()` method without proper sanitization. The attacker exploits a vulnerability where user-supplied data is directly concatenated into the HTML content set by `.html()`.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker's script executes in the context of the user's browser, allowing them to steal cookies, redirect the user, deface the page, or perform other malicious actions (classic XSS).
    *   **D3 Component Affected:** `d3-selection`'s `.html()` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `.html()` with User Input:**  *Strongly* prefer using `.text()` to set text content, as it automatically escapes HTML entities. This is the primary and most effective mitigation.
        *   **HTML Sanitization:** If `.html()` *must* be used with user-provided data, use a robust HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify *before* passing the data to D3.  *Never* rely on D3's internal escaping for this.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the damage from XSS, even if a vulnerability exists.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [XSS via Unsafe Attribute Manipulation with `.attr()`](./threats/xss_via_unsafe_attribute_manipulation_with___attr___.md)

*   **Threat:** XSS via Unsafe Attribute Manipulation with `.attr()`

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into SVG attributes (e.g., `onclick`, `onload`, `onmouseover`, or `xlink:href` in older browsers) using D3's `.attr()` method with unsanitized user input. The vulnerability lies in directly using user input to set attribute values that can execute JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to the `.html()` XSS, the attacker's script executes in the user's browser, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
    *   **D3 Component Affected:** `d3-selection`'s `.attr()` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Attribute Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize *all* attribute values set using `.attr()` when those values are derived from user-provided data.  Use a dedicated sanitization library (like DOMPurify) configured specifically for SVG. This is crucial.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Event Handlers:**  Prefer setting event handlers using D3's `.on()` method with function references, rather than constructing event handler strings dynamically within attributes.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Attributes:**  If possible, restrict the set of attributes that can be modified by user input to a known safe list, preventing the setting of event handler attributes.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A strong CSP can mitigate the impact of XSS, acting as an additional layer of defense.

## Threat: [XSS via Dynamically Constructed Event Handlers](./threats/xss_via_dynamically_constructed_event_handlers.md)

*   **Threat:**  XSS via Dynamically Constructed Event Handlers

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides input that is used to construct event handler strings dynamically, which are then passed to D3's `.on()` method.  This allows the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code directly into the event handler, bypassing typical escaping mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to the same consequences as other XSS vulnerabilities (data theft, session hijacking, etc.).
    *   **D3 Component Affected:** `d3-selection`'s `.on()` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Event Handler Strings:**  *Always* define event handlers as separate functions and pass the function *reference* to `.on()`.  *Never* construct event handler strings by concatenating user input or any untrusted data. This is the most important mitigation.  For example:
            ```javascript
            // VULNERABLE:
            selection.on("click", "alert('" + userInput + "')");

            // SAFE:
            function handleClick() {
              // Sanitize userInput here if needed (but ideally before this)
              alert(sanitizedUserInput);
            }
            selection.on("click", handleClick);
            ```
        *   **Input Sanitization (as a last resort):** If dynamic construction is absolutely unavoidable (which is strongly discouraged), sanitize the input *extremely* carefully before including it in the event handler string.  However, this is highly error-prone and should be avoided in favor of the previous mitigation.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in D3.js Itself (High/Critical)](./threats/vulnerability_in_d3_js_itself__highcritical_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Vulnerability in D3.js Itself (High/Critical)

    *   **Description:** A *high or critical severity* security vulnerability is discovered in the D3.js library itself. This is distinct from vulnerabilities in plugins. The attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but for high/critical issues, it could range from client-side DoS to XSS or potentially (though less likely with D3) arbitrary code execution.
    *   **D3 Component Affected:**  Any part of D3.js, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High or Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep D3 Updated:**  Regularly update to the *latest* version of D3.js to receive security patches. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow the D3.js project on GitHub (or other relevant channels) to be notified of any vulnerabilities.
        *   **Use a Dependency Management Tool:**  Use npm or yarn to manage D3.js, making updates easier and more reliable.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use an SCA tool to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, including D3.js.
