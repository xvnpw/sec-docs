## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exfiltration (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exfiltration__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Data Binding Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** D3.js binds data directly to DOM elements.  If this data is not properly sanitized, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **1.1.1 Craft Malicious Data:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker prepares data containing malicious code (e.g., JavaScript within an SVG attribute).
        *   **1.1.1.1 Trigger XSS via Data Attributes [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data that D3.js uses to set HTML or SVG attributes (e.g., `title`, `xlink:href`, or even custom data attributes).  When D3 renders the element, the browser executes the injected script. This is a classic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, made possible by D3's lack of built-in sanitization.
            *   **Likelihood (High):** This is highly likely if input sanitization is absent or flawed.  It's a common oversight.
            *   **Impact (High):** Successful XSS allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.  This can lead to:
                *   Stealing cookies and session tokens (session hijacking).
                *   Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page.
                *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website (phishing).
                *   Defacing the website.
                *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
            *   **Effort (Low):** Crafting a basic XSS payload is relatively simple.  Many readily available examples and tools exist.
            *   **Skill Level (Medium):** Requires understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and how D3 binds data to attributes.  More sophisticated XSS attacks (e.g., bypassing weak sanitization) require higher skill.
            *   **Detection Difficulty (Medium):** Can be detected with:
                *   **Code Review:** Carefully examining how user-supplied data is used in D3.
                *   **Input Validation Testing:**  Trying various XSS payloads to see if they execute.
                *   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:**  Using web application security scanners that automatically test for XSS.
                *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A well-configured CSP can prevent the execution of injected scripts, even if the XSS vulnerability exists.  This is a *mitigation*, not a detection method.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (D3-Specific) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__d3-specific___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **3.1 Overload Rendering Engine:**
    *   **Description:** D3.js, especially with large datasets or complex visualizations, can be computationally intensive.  An attacker can exploit this to cause a denial-of-service.
    *   **3.1.1 Feed Extremely Large Dataset:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker provides an excessively large dataset to the D3 application.
        *   **3.1.1.1 Trigger Browser Crash/Freeze [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker sends a dataset so large that D3's rendering process overwhelms the browser's resources (CPU and memory).  This causes the browser tab, or potentially the entire browser, to become unresponsive or crash.  This is a client-side denial-of-service.
            *   **Likelihood (Medium):**  Relatively easy to achieve if the application doesn't have any limits on the size of the input data.
            *   **Impact (Medium):**  The user's browser becomes unusable, preventing them from interacting with the application.  While data isn't necessarily stolen, the application's availability is compromised.
            *   **Effort (Low):**  The attacker simply needs to create a large dataset.  This can be done with simple scripts.
            *   **Skill Level (Medium):**  Requires minimal technical skill.  Understanding of data formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) might be helpful.
            *   **Detection Difficulty (Medium):**
                *   **Easy to detect the *symptom*:** The browser becomes unresponsive.
                *   **Harder to detect the *cause*:**  Requires investigation to determine that a large dataset was the culprit.  Server-side logging of input data sizes can help.
                *   **Mitigation:** Input validation to limit dataset size, pagination, data aggregation, and using Web Workers can prevent this.
