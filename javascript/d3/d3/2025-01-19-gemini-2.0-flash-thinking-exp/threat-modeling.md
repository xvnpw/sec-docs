# Threat Model Analysis for d3/d3

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Data Injection](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data that is subsequently used by D3 to render elements on the page. This could be through manipulating data sources the application relies on or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles user-provided data that feeds into D3 visualizations.
    *   **Mechanism:** D3's data binding capabilities can render arbitrary content based on the provided data. If this data contains unescaped or unsanitized HTML or JavaScript, D3 will render it, leading to the execution of the malicious script in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the application. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or the execution of other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected D3 Component:**
    *   `d3-selection`: Specifically functions like `selection.text()`, `selection.html()`, `selection.append()`, `selection.insert()`, and any function that directly renders data into the DOM.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided data before using it with D3 rendering functions (e.g., `selection.text()`, `selection.html()`). Use browser-provided escaping mechanisms or dedicated sanitization libraries.
    *   Avoid using `selection.html()` with untrusted data. Prefer `selection.text()` for displaying plain text.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts. This can help mitigate the impact of successful XSS.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known or Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in D3](./threats/exploitation_of_known_or_zero-day_vulnerabilities_in_d3.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within the D3.js library itself to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Mechanism:** Like any software library, D3 might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities or known vulnerabilities that haven't been patched in the application's version. Attackers can leverage these flaws to compromise the client-side application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, the impact could range from arbitrary code execution in the user's browser to information disclosure or a client-side denial of service.
*   **Affected D3 Component:**
    *   Potentially any module within the D3 library, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if a critical vulnerability exists)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update D3.js to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to D3.js.
    *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
