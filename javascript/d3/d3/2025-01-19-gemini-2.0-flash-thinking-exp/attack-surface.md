# Attack Surface Analysis for d3/d3

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_data_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is then rendered by D3.js, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
    * **How D3 Contributes to the Attack Surface:** D3.js functions like `.html()` or `.text()` on selections can render unsanitized data as HTML, including script tags or event handlers. If the application doesn't sanitize data before passing it to these D3 functions, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a JSON payload for a chart where a label contains `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`. When D3 renders this label using `.html()`, the script will execute.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the application and data).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Strict Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Always sanitize or escape user-provided or external data before using it with D3's DOM manipulation functions. Use methods that treat data as plain text rather than HTML by default (e.g., `.text()` where appropriate, or use secure templating libraries).
            * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS.
            * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security reviews of the code to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks (Dependency Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks__dependency_vulnerabilities_.md)

* **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist within the D3.js library itself, which an attacker could exploit if the application uses a vulnerable version.
    * **How D3 Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The application directly depends on the D3.js library. If D3 has a security flaw, any application using that version is potentially vulnerable.
    * **Example:** A known XSS vulnerability exists in an older version of D3.js. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application is using that outdated version.
    * **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including XSS, remote code execution, or information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep D3.js and all other dependencies up-to-date with the latest stable versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
            * **Dependency Scanning Tools:** Use automated tools to scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and receive alerts about potential risks.
