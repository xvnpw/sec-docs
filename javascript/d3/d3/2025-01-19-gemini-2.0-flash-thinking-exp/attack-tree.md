# Attack Tree Analysis for d3/d3

Objective: Compromise application by exploiting weaknesses in D3.js.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Compromise Application Using D3.js [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Exploit Malicious Data Injection [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Inject Malicious Data via Application Input --> Execute arbitrary JavaScript (XSS) [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Inject Malicious SVG/HTML via D3.js Manipulation --> Execute arbitrary JavaScript (XSS), Deface Application
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH if using outdated version]** Exploit Vulnerabilities in D3.js Library --> Execute arbitrary JavaScript (XSS), DoS [CRITICAL NODE if outdated]
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using D3.js [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_d3_js__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation along the high-risk paths will lead to the compromise of the application.
*   **Significance:** This node represents the overall security objective and highlights the potential for attackers to leverage D3.js vulnerabilities to achieve their goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Malicious Data Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_malicious_data_injection__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to inject malicious data that is then processed and rendered by D3.js, leading to unintended and harmful actions. This can occur through various input points or compromised data sources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common web application vulnerability).
*   **Impact:** High (Potential for XSS, data theft, account compromise).
*   **Criticality:** This node is critical because it represents a broad category of highly probable and impactful attacks directly related to how the application handles data with D3.js. Effective mitigation at this level can prevent multiple downstream attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Data via Application Input --> Execute arbitrary JavaScript (XSS) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__inject_malicious_data_via_application_input_--_execute_arbitrary_javascript__xss____053fab8c.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide malicious input (e.g., through form fields, URL parameters) that is not properly sanitized and is subsequently used by D3.js to manipulate the DOM, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (Cross-Site Scripting).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common vulnerability, but awareness is increasing).
*   **Impact:** High (Account compromise, data theft, malicious actions on behalf of the user).
*   **Effort:** Low (Often achievable with basic browser tools).
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate (Understanding of HTML/JS injection).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by WAFs and CSP, but sophisticated attacks can evade).
*   **Criticality:** This node is a critical entry point for attackers. Its direct link to XSS makes it a high-priority target for mitigation through robust input validation and sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious SVG/HTML via D3.js Manipulation --> Execute arbitrary JavaScript (XSS), Deface Application](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__inject_malicious_svghtml_via_d3_js_manipulation_--_execute_arbitrary_javascript__xs_71cdc505.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate data or application state to cause D3.js to render malicious SVG or HTML elements containing embedded JavaScript or other harmful attributes. This can lead to XSS or defacement of the application's user interface.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Developers might overlook SVG/HTML injection risks via D3).
*   **Impact:** Medium/High (XSS, defacement, potential for phishing).
*   **Effort:** Low/Medium (Requires understanding of D3.js and SVG/HTML structure).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Understanding of DOM manipulation and SVG/HTML).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by CSP and anomaly detection).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH if using outdated version] Exploit Vulnerabilities in D3.js Library --> Execute arbitrary JavaScript (XSS), DoS [CRITICAL NODE if outdated]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path_if_using_outdated_version__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_d3_js_library_--_execute_arbit_bf50872a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities present in the specific version of the D3.js library used by the application. This can involve using publicly available exploits or developing custom exploits. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution or Denial of Service.
*   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium (Depends on the age and popularity of the D3.js version used). This becomes a **High-Risk Path** if the application uses an outdated version with known, readily exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** High (Can lead to full compromise depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Effort:** Low (If an exploit is publicly available) / High (If a 0-day is needed).
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner (If using an existing exploit) / Advanced (For 0-day).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Exploits can be crafted to be stealthy).
*   **Criticality:** This node is critical if the application is running an outdated version of D3.js. Failing to update the library exposes the application to known and potentially easily exploitable vulnerabilities.
