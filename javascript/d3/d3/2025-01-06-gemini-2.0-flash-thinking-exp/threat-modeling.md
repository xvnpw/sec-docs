# Threat Model Analysis for d3/d3

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Data Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_data_rendering.md)

* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Data Rendering
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious data into the application's data source that is subsequently used by D3.js to render content. This malicious data contains JavaScript code disguised as data values.
        * **How:** When D3.js processes this data and uses functions like `.html()` or manipulating the `innerHTML` property based on the malicious data, the injected script is executed within the user's browser.
    * **Impact:**
        * The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the application.
        * This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or the execution of other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Affected D3 Component:**
        * **Modules/Functions:**  Primarily affects functions used for dynamic content generation based on data, such as:
            * `selection.html(value)` when `value` is derived from an untrusted source.
            * Operations that directly manipulate the DOM based on data, leading to the insertion of script tags or event handlers with malicious code.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate all data received from untrusted sources *before* passing it to D3.js for rendering. Use appropriate encoding techniques for the output context (HTML encoding).
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load and execute, significantly reducing the impact of XSS.
        * **Avoid `selection.html()` with Untrusted Data:**  Prefer safer methods like `selection.text()` or creating DOM elements programmatically and setting their properties.
        * **Output Encoding:** Ensure that data being displayed is properly encoded to prevent it from being interpreted as executable code.

## Threat: [Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/client-side_denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Threat:** Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker provides a specially crafted, excessively large, or deeply nested dataset to the application.
        * **How:** When D3.js attempts to process and render this complex data, it can consume excessive CPU and memory resources in the user's browser, leading to performance degradation, browser freezing, or even crashing.
    * **Impact:**
        * The application becomes unresponsive or unusable for the victim.
        * Degrades the user experience significantly.
        * In severe cases, can force the user to close their browser.
    * **Affected D3 Component:**
        * **Modules/Functions:** Affects core data manipulation and rendering functions, particularly when dealing with large datasets:
            * `d3.select()` and `d3.selectAll()` when selecting a massive number of elements.
            * Data joining operations (`selection.data()`, `selection.enter()`, `selection.exit()`) with very large datasets.
            * Complex visualization logic that involves numerous DOM manipulations.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Data Size Limits:** Implement server-side validation to limit the size and complexity of data accepted by the application.
        * **Pagination or Lazy Loading:** For large datasets, implement pagination or lazy loading techniques to render data in smaller chunks.
        * **Optimize D3 Code:** Optimize D3.js code for performance, avoiding unnecessary DOM manipulations and using efficient data structures.
        * **Throttling/Debouncing:** If real-time updates are involved, implement throttling or debouncing to limit the frequency of D3 rendering operations.
        * **Client-Side Resource Monitoring:** Consider implementing client-side monitoring to detect and potentially mitigate excessive resource usage.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised D3 Library](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_d3_library.md)

* **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack via Compromised D3 Library
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises the official D3.js library or a widely used CDN hosting the library.
        * **How:**  The attacker injects malicious code into the library's source code. When the application loads this compromised library, the malicious code is executed in the user's browser.
    * **Impact:**
        * Full compromise of the application running the compromised library.
        * Ability to steal user credentials, inject malware, or perform other malicious actions.
        * Widespread impact if the compromised library is used by many applications.
    * **Affected D3 Component:**
        * **Modules/Functions:**  Potentially all modules and functions of the D3 library, as the attacker has control over the entire codebase.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags when including D3.js from a CDN to ensure the integrity of the downloaded file. The browser will verify the file's hash against the provided value and prevent loading if it doesn't match.
        * **Host Library Locally:** Consider hosting the D3.js library from your own infrastructure to have more control over its integrity.
        * **Regularly Update:** Keep the D3.js library updated to the latest version, as updates often include security fixes.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan your project's dependencies (including D3.js) for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in D3 Dependencies (If Any)](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_d3_dependencies__if_any_.md)

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in D3 Dependencies (If Any)
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:**  While D3.js has minimal direct dependencies, future versions or extensions might rely on other libraries with known vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through the D3.js integration.
        * **How:** The attacker targets a known vulnerability in a D3.js dependency, potentially through crafted input or by triggering specific D3.js functionality that utilizes the vulnerable dependency.
    * **Impact:**
        * The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from code execution to denial of service.
    * **Affected D3 Component:**
        * **Modules/Functions:**  The specific D3.js modules or functions that utilize the vulnerable dependency would be affected.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Dependency Management:**  Maintain a clear understanding of D3.js's dependencies (if any).
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep D3.js and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and track vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
