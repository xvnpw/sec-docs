## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN Usage of d3.js](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for_cdn_usage_of_d3_js.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI Hash for d3.js:** When using a CDN to load d3.js, generate the SRI hash specifically for the d3.js file you are using from the CDN. Tools or online generators can be used to calculate the SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 hash of the d3.js file.
    2.  **Add SRI Attribute to d3.js Script Tag:** Include the `integrity` attribute in the `<script>` tag that loads d3.js from the CDN. Set the value of the `integrity` attribute to the generated SRI hash, prefixed with the chosen hash algorithm (e.g., `sha384-`).
    3.  **Add `crossorigin="anonymous"` to d3.js Script Tag:** Include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute in the `<script>` tag when using SRI with CDNs for d3.js to ensure proper error reporting and cross-origin resource sharing for the d3.js file.
    4.  **Verify SRI Implementation for d3.js:** Test that the browser correctly loads d3.js using SRI by checking the browser's developer console for any SRI-related errors specifically when loading the d3.js script.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   CDN Compromise (Medium to High Severity): Prevents execution of malicious code injected into the d3.js file on a compromised CDN, ensuring only the intended d3.js code is executed.
    *   Accidental CDN File Modification (Low to Medium Severity): Protects against unintended changes to the d3.js file on the CDN that could introduce vulnerabilities or break the functionality of visualizations relying on d3.js.
*   **Impact:**
    *   CDN Compromise: Significantly reduces risk by ensuring the integrity of the loaded d3.js file.
    *   Accidental CDN File Modification: Moderately reduces risk by verifying the integrity of the d3.js file.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No, SRI is not currently implemented for CDN loaded libraries, including d3.js.
    *   Not implemented in: HTML templates where d3.js is loaded from CDN.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement SRI specifically for the d3.js library when loaded from a CDN across all HTML templates.
    *   Document the process of generating and updating SRI hashes for the d3.js CDN dependency.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Controlled Data Used in d3.js Visualizations](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-controlled_data_used_in_d3_js_visualizations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Data Sources for d3.js:** Identify all sources of user-controlled data that are used *specifically* in d3.js visualizations (e.g., data points, labels, tooltips derived from query parameters, form inputs, API responses).
    2.  **Choose Sanitization Method for d3.js Context:** Select appropriate sanitization methods based on the context of how the data is used within d3.js and the type of data. Consider output encoding for text content, input validation for data values, and sanitization libraries for HTML content if used with d3.js methods like `.html()`.
    3.  **Apply Sanitization Before d3.js DOM Manipulation:** Apply the chosen sanitization method to user-controlled data *before* using it to manipulate the DOM with d3.js methods like `.html()`, `.text()`, `.attr()`, or `.style()`. This ensures that d3.js is working with safe data.
    4.  **Context-Specific Sanitization for d3.js:** Apply different sanitization techniques depending on how d3.js is using the data. For example, sanitize differently for text labels rendered with `.text()` versus HTML tooltips rendered with `.html()`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity): Prevents injection of malicious scripts into visualizations through user-supplied data that is processed and rendered by d3.js.
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: Significantly reduces risk by preventing malicious script execution within d3.js visualizations.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial implementation, basic output encoding is used in some areas for user-displayed text within d3.js visualizations.
    *   Implemented in: Specific visualization components displaying user-generated text content using d3.js.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent and comprehensive sanitization across *all* d3.js visualizations that use user-controlled data.
    *   Use of a dedicated sanitization library like DOMPurify specifically for HTML content used with d3.js's `.html()` method.
    *   Input validation and filtering on the server-side before data reaches the client-side d3.js code used for visualizations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Safe D3.js Methods for Text Content in Visualizations](./mitigation_strategies/use_safe_d3_js_methods_for_text_content_in_visualizations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer `.text()` over `.html()` in d3.js:** When displaying text content derived from user input or external sources within d3.js visualizations, prioritize using the `.text()` method. `.text()` treats the input as plain text and automatically encodes HTML special characters, preventing HTML injection vulnerabilities when rendering text with d3.js.
    2.  **Use `.html()` with Extreme Caution in d3.js:** Reserve the use of `.html()` in d3.js for situations where you explicitly need to render HTML content within visualizations and are absolutely certain that the input is safe and trusted.
    3.  **Sanitize Input for `.html()` in d3.js:** If you must use `.html()` with user-controlled data in d3.js, ensure that you rigorously sanitize the input using a robust sanitization library (like DOMPurify) *before* passing it to `.html()` within your d3.js code.
    4.  **Review Code for `.html()` Usage in d3.js:** Conduct code reviews to identify all instances where `.html()` is used in d3.js code within visualizations and verify that the input is properly sanitized or comes from a trusted source.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity): Reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities arising from improper use of `.html()` with unsanitized user data within d3.js visualizations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: Moderately reduces risk by promoting safer coding practices within d3.js and minimizing the attack surface related to `.html()` in visualizations.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented, developers are generally aware of preferring `.text()` in d3.js, but `.html()` usage in visualizations is not consistently reviewed for security.
    *   Implemented in: Coding style guidelines mention preferring `.text()` when using d3.js for text rendering.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated code analysis tools to detect and flag potentially unsafe `.html()` usage in d3.js code within visualizations.
    *   Mandatory code reviews specifically focusing on `.html()` usage and input sanitization in visualization components using d3.js.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Performance Optimization of D3.js Code for DoS Prevention](./mitigation_strategies/performance_optimization_of_d3_js_code_for_dos_prevention.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Efficient D3.js Data Processing:** Optimize data processing and manipulation *within* your d3.js code. Avoid unnecessary computations, data transformations, or DOM manipulations that can strain client-side resources when rendering visualizations.
    2.  **Minimize D3.js DOM Updates:** Reduce the number of DOM updates performed by d3.js. Utilize d3.js's features like data binding, enter/update/exit patterns, and consider virtual DOM techniques (if applicable with your d3.js setup) to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the visualization, preventing performance bottlenecks.
    3.  **Debouncing and Throttling for D3.js Interactions:** For interactive visualizations built with d3.js, use debouncing or throttling techniques to limit the frequency of d3.js updates in response to user interactions (e.g., mouse movements, zooming, panning). This prevents excessive re-rendering and resource consumption.
    4.  **Canvas or WebGL Rendering with d3.js (for large datasets):** For visualizations with very large datasets rendered using d3.js, consider using Canvas or WebGL rendering instead of SVG.  While d3.js works with SVG by default, integrating it with Canvas or WebGL (often via libraries that bridge d3.js and these technologies) can offer better performance for rendering a large number of graphical elements, mitigating potential DoS issues.
    5.  **Code Profiling and Optimization of d3.js Code:** Use browser developer tools to profile your d3.js code and identify performance bottlenecks *within your visualization logic*. Optimize your d3.js code based on profiling results to improve rendering efficiency and reduce resource consumption.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of client-side DoS caused by inefficient d3.js code that consumes excessive resources, making visualizations unresponsive or crashing the browser.
    *   Poor User Experience (Low to Medium Severity): Improves visualization performance and responsiveness, leading to a better user experience and reducing frustration that could be exploited in social engineering attacks targeting users experiencing slow or unresponsive visualizations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS: Moderately reduces risk by improving performance and resource utilization of d3.js visualizations.
    *   Poor User Experience: Moderately reduces risk by enhancing usability and responsiveness of d3.js visualizations.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   General performance optimization practices are followed, but no specific focus on d3.js code optimization for security and DoS prevention in visualizations.
    *   Implemented in: General development best practices.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Specific guidelines and code reviews focused on performance optimization of d3.js visualizations for security and DoS prevention.
    *   Performance testing and profiling of d3.js visualizations as a standard part of the development process, with a focus on resource consumption and rendering efficiency.
