# Attack Surface Analysis for pi-hole/pi-hole

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** Pi-hole's web admin interface may contain XSS vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized before being displayed.
*   **Example:** Injecting malicious JavaScript into the "Custom DNS Records" input field, leading to session cookie theft when an admin views the settings page.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to Pi-hole settings, potential redirection of users to malicious websites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding in the web interface. Use Content Security Policy (CSP). Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration testing.
    *   **Users:** Keep Pi-hole updated. Use strong passwords. Access admin interface from trusted networks.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Command injection vulnerabilities occur when an application executes system commands based on unsanitized user input.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** Pi-hole's web interface or backend scripts might be vulnerable if they use user input to construct system commands without proper validation.
*   **Example:** Exploiting a custom script execution feature (if present) by injecting shell commands into an input field, gaining shell access to the Pi-hole server.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, malware installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Avoid system commands based on user input. Use parameterized commands or secure libraries. Strictly validate and sanitize all user input. Apply principle of least privilege.
    *   **Users:** Keep Pi-hole updated. Avoid untrusted third-party scripts. Restrict access to the Pi-hole server and admin interface.

## Attack Surface: [DNS Query Amplification Attacks (Open Resolver Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/dns_query_amplification_attacks__open_resolver_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** DNS amplification attacks exploit publicly accessible DNS resolvers to amplify traffic towards a victim.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** Misconfiguring Pi-hole as an open resolver (listening on a public IP) allows it to be abused in DNS amplification attacks.
*   **Example:** Attackers sending numerous DNS queries to a public Pi-hole instance with spoofed victim IP, causing a DDoS attack on the victim.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service for the victim, potential blacklisting of the Pi-hole server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if misconfigured as open resolver)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Ensure default configuration is NOT an open resolver. Document and warn against open resolver configuration.
    *   **Users:** **Crucially, ensure Pi-hole DNS resolver is NOT exposed to the public internet.** Configure it to listen only on the local network interface. Use a firewall to block external DNS port access.

## Attack Surface: [Software Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Web Server, PHP, dnsmasq/FTLDNS)](./attack_surfaces/software_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies__web_server__php__dnsmasqftldns_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Pi-hole's dependencies (web server, PHP, DNS resolver) can be exploited.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** Pi-hole relies on these components; outdated versions with known vulnerabilities expose Pi-hole.
*   **Example:** Exploiting a CVE in the `lighttpd` web server version used by Pi-hole to gain remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Varies, from information disclosure and DoS to remote code execution and system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Keep dependencies updated with security patches. Monitor security advisories. Use dependency scanning tools.
    *   **Users:** **Keep Pi-hole software updated regularly through the official update mechanism.** Keep the underlying OS updated. Stay informed about security announcements.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism (If HTTP was used - mitigated by HTTPS)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism__if_http_was_used_-_mitigated_by_https_.md)

*   **Description:** Using unencrypted HTTP for updates allows Man-in-the-Middle attacks to inject malicious code.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** Historically, if Pi-hole used HTTP for updates, it would have been vulnerable.
*   **Example:** Intercepting an HTTP update request and replacing the legitimate package with a malicious one, compromising the system during update.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise during the update process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if HTTP was used)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** **Use HTTPS for all update downloads.** Implement signature verification for update packages.
    *   **Users:** Ensure Pi-hole uses official update channels. Verify updates are over HTTPS (generally automatic).

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Admin Interface to the Internet](./attack_surfaces/exposed_admin_interface_to_the_internet.md)

*   **Description:** Making the Pi-hole admin interface publicly accessible increases the attack surface significantly.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** Pi-hole provides a web admin interface; exposing it to the internet makes it a target.
*   **Example:** Internet-based brute-force login attacks, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation attempts against the admin interface.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Pi-hole settings, potential system compromise, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Warn against public exposure in documentation. Implement secure default settings restricting admin interface access to the local network.
    *   **Users:** **Never expose the Pi-hole admin interface directly to the public internet.** Access it only from trusted local networks or via VPN. Use firewall rules to restrict access.
