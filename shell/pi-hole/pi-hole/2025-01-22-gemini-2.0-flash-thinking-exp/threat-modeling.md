# Threat Model Analysis for pi-hole/pi-hole

## Threat: [DNS Spoofing/Poisoning via Pi-hole Compromise](./threats/dns_spoofingpoisoning_via_pi-hole_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Pi-hole server (e.g., through OS vulnerabilities, weak credentials, or software exploits). Once compromised, the attacker can manipulate DNS responses served by Pi-hole. For example, when a user tries to access `example.com`, Pi-hole, under attacker control, could return the IP address of a malicious server instead of the legitimate one.
*   **Impact:** Users are redirected to malicious websites, potentially leading to:
    *   **Phishing:** Users unknowingly enter credentials on fake login pages.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Users are served malware disguised as legitimate software or updates.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Users' browser traffic is routed through attacker-controlled servers, allowing for interception and data theft.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** `dnsmasq` (DNS resolver component), potentially the underlying operating system and web interface if used for initial compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update Pi-hole and the underlying operating system:** Patch vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   **Harden the Pi-hole server:** Follow security best practices for server hardening, including strong passwords, disabling unnecessary services, and using firewalls.
    *   **Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity targeting the Pi-hole server.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically assess the security of the Pi-hole server and its configuration.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit access to the Pi-hole server and its web interface to only authorized personnel.

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass in Web Interface](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Pi-hole web interface (written in PHP) could allow attackers to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms. This could be due to flaws in session management, input validation, or access control logic. An attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities to gain administrative access without valid credentials.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration Tampering:** Attackers can modify Pi-hole settings, disable filtering, change DNS settings, or add malicious domains to whitelists.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive information displayed in the web interface, such as DNS query logs, network configurations, and potentially user credentials if stored insecurely (though Pi-hole aims to avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in the web interface).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could disrupt Pi-hole's functionality through misconfiguration or by overloading the web server.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** `lighttpd` (web server), PHP scripts in the web interface (e.g., API endpoints, login mechanisms, configuration pages).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update Pi-hole:** Ensure the web interface components are patched against known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use Strong Passwords for Web Interface:** Enforce strong and unique passwords for the Pi-hole web interface administrator account.
    *   **Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) if available or through reverse proxy:** Add an extra layer of security to web interface login.
    *   **Restrict Web Interface Access:** Limit access to the web interface to only authorized networks or IP addresses (e.g., internal management network).
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (optional, for advanced setups):** Deploy a WAF in front of the Pi-hole web interface to detect and block common web attacks.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering via Web Interface](./threats/configuration_tampering_via_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Pi-hole web interface (through compromised credentials or vulnerabilities), they can tamper with Pi-hole's configuration settings. This includes modifying blocklists, whitelists, DNS settings, DHCP settings (if enabled), and other parameters.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Disable Filtering:** Attackers can disable ad-blocking and tracking protection, negating Pi-hole's primary security benefit.
    *   **Whitelist Malicious Domains:** Attackers can add malicious domains to the whitelist, allowing them to bypass filtering and potentially infect users.
    *   **Modify DNS Settings:** Attackers can change upstream DNS servers to malicious ones, leading to DNS spoofing even if Pi-hole itself is not directly compromised.
    *   **DHCP Manipulation (if enabled):** Attackers can modify DHCP settings to assign malicious DNS servers, gateway addresses, or other network parameters to clients.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** Web interface (PHP scripts handling configuration changes), configuration files used by `dnsmasq` and `lighttpd`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Web Interface Access:** Implement strong authentication, authorization, and access control for the web interface (as described in Threat 2 mitigations).
    *   **Regularly Review Configuration Changes:** Monitor Pi-hole's configuration for unauthorized modifications. Consider using configuration management tools to track and revert changes.
    *   **Backup Pi-hole Configuration:** Regularly back up Pi-hole's configuration to allow for quick restoration in case of tampering.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Pi-hole Software Components](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_pi-hole_software_components.md)

*   **Description:** Pi-hole is built upon various software components like `lighttpd`, `dnsmasq`, PHP, and the underlying operating system. These components may contain security vulnerabilities. If vulnerabilities are discovered and not patched, attackers can exploit them to compromise Pi-hole.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Pi-hole Compromise:** Attackers can gain control of the Pi-hole server, leading to DNS spoofing, configuration tampering, and other malicious activities (as described in previous threats).
    *   **Lateral Movement:** In a network environment, a compromised Pi-hole server could be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** All Pi-hole software components: `lighttpd`, `dnsmasq`, PHP, underlying operating system, and Pi-hole specific scripts and web interface code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Pi-hole and Underlying OS:** Apply security updates promptly to patch known vulnerabilities in all components.
    *   **Subscribe to Security Mailing Lists/Advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities affecting Pi-hole and its components.
    *   **Security Scanning and Vulnerability Assessments:** Periodically scan the Pi-hole server for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   **Follow Security Best Practices for System Administration:** Harden the Pi-hole server and minimize its attack surface.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Pi-hole DNS Service](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_pi-hole_dns_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Pi-hole server with a large volume of DNS requests. This can overwhelm Pi-hole's DNS resolver (`dnsmasq`) and the server's resources, causing it to become unresponsive and unable to process legitimate DNS queries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DNS Resolution Failure:** Users and applications on the network lose the ability to resolve domain names, disrupting network connectivity and application functionality.
    *   **Network Outage (partial or full):** Depending on the application's reliance on DNS, a Pi-hole DoS can lead to significant service disruptions or even a network outage.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** `dnsmasq` (DNS resolver component), potentially the network infrastructure if the attack is large enough.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the application's criticality and network resilience)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (if available in `dnsmasq` or firewall):** Limit the rate of DNS requests processed by Pi-hole to prevent overwhelming the server.
    *   **Implement Network Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** An IPS can detect and block DoS attacks targeting the Pi-hole server.
    *   **DNS Caching and Redundancy:** Implement local DNS caching on client devices and consider redundant DNS servers to mitigate the impact of a single Pi-hole failure.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor Pi-hole server resources (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts for unusual spikes that might indicate a DoS attack.
    *   **Proper Network Segmentation:** Isolate Pi-hole within a secure network segment to limit the impact of a broader network compromise.
