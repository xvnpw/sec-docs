### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. [1.2.2.a] DHCP Starvation to cause DoS [HIGH RISK]

**Attack Vector:**

DHCP starvation is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that targets the DHCP server's address pool. The attacker floods the Pi-hole DHCP server with a large number of DHCP Discover packets. These packets are typically crafted with spoofed MAC addresses, making each request appear to originate from a unique device.

When the Pi-hole DHCP server receives these requests, it attempts to allocate IP addresses from its configured pool.  If the rate of malicious DHCP Discover packets is high enough, the DHCP server will quickly exhaust its available IP address pool.

**Detailed Steps of the Attack:**

1.  **Attacker Preparation:** The attacker uses a tool or script capable of generating and sending DHCP Discover packets with spoofed MAC addresses.
2.  **Flood of DHCP Discover Packets:** The attacker initiates a flood of these crafted DHCP Discover packets towards the network where the Pi-hole DHCP server is listening.
3.  **DHCP Server Processing:** The Pi-hole DHCP server receives and processes each DHCP Discover packet, attempting to allocate a new IP address for each unique MAC address.
4.  **Address Pool Exhaustion:** Due to the high volume of requests, the DHCP server's IP address pool is rapidly depleted.
5.  **Denial of Service:** Once the address pool is exhausted, legitimate devices attempting to obtain or renew IP addresses via DHCP will fail. The Pi-hole DHCP server will be unable to assign new IP addresses, leading to network connectivity disruption for these devices.

**Impact:**

*   **Network Connectivity Disruption:** Devices relying on DHCP from Pi-hole will be unable to obtain IP addresses, resulting in loss of network connectivity. This includes internet access and potentially local network communication if IP addresses are required.
*   **Operational Disruption:** Users will experience a loss of network services, impacting productivity and potentially critical operations that depend on network access.
*   **Difficult Troubleshooting:**  Diagnosing DHCP starvation can be challenging initially, as users may simply report "no internet" or "network not working." Administrators need to investigate DHCP server logs and network traffic to identify the root cause.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Implement DHCP Snooping on Network Switches:**
    *   **Mechanism:** DHCP snooping is a Layer 2 security feature implemented on managed network switches. It acts as a security guard for DHCP traffic.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Trusted Ports:**  Administrators configure specific switch ports as "trusted," typically those connected to legitimate DHCP servers (like the port Pi-hole is connected to).
        *   **Untrusted Ports:** All other ports are considered "untrusted," usually ports connected to end-user devices.
        *   **DHCP Message Filtering:** DHCP snooping intercepts DHCP messages (Discover, Offer, Request, ACK) passing through the switch.
        *   **DHCP Server Message Filtering:** It allows DHCP Offer and ACK messages only from trusted ports. DHCP Offer/ACK messages from untrusted ports are dropped, preventing rogue DHCP servers.
        *   **DHCP Request Rate Limiting:** DHCP snooping can also limit the rate of DHCP Request messages from untrusted ports, mitigating DHCP starvation attacks by limiting the number of requests processed from potentially malicious sources.
    *   **Effectiveness:** DHCP snooping is highly effective in preventing DHCP starvation attacks originating from untrusted network segments. It ensures that only authorized DHCP servers can provide IP addresses and limits the impact of malicious DHCP requests.

*   **Limit DHCP Lease Times:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Configure shorter DHCP lease times in the Pi-hole DHCP server settings.
    *   **Functionality:** Shorter lease times mean that IP addresses are returned to the DHCP pool more frequently when devices disconnect or leases expire.
    *   **Effectiveness:** While shorter lease times do not directly prevent DHCP starvation, they can reduce the duration and impact of the attack. If the address pool is exhausted, shorter leases will allow it to recover faster once the attack stops, as IP addresses will be reclaimed and become available sooner. However, excessively short lease times can increase network traffic due to frequent lease renewals and may put additional load on the DHCP server and clients. A balance needs to be found based on the network environment.

*   **Monitor DHCP Server Logs for Excessive Requests:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Regularly monitor Pi-hole's DHCP server logs (typically accessible via the Pi-hole web interface or command line).
    *   **Functionality:** Analyze logs for patterns indicative of a DHCP starvation attack, such as:
        *   **High Volume of DHCP Discover Requests:**  An unusually large number of DHCP Discover requests in a short period.
        *   **Address Pool Exhaustion Warnings:**  Log messages indicating that the DHCP address pool is running low or has been exhausted.
        *   **Requests from Unknown MAC Addresses:**  A surge in DHCP requests from MAC addresses not typically seen on the network.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Log monitoring provides early detection of DHCP starvation attacks. Automated alerting based on log analysis can further enhance detection and enable faster incident response.

#### 4.2. [1.2.2.b] Rogue DHCP Server attack (if Pi-hole is not properly secured in the network) [HIGH RISK]

**Attack Vector:**

A rogue DHCP server attack involves an attacker introducing an unauthorized DHCP server onto the network. This rogue server competes with the legitimate Pi-hole DHCP server to respond to DHCP Discover requests from clients. If the rogue DHCP server responds faster or with a more attractive offer, clients may inadvertently obtain network configurations from the malicious server instead of the legitimate one.

**Detailed Steps of the Attack:**

1.  **Attacker Setup:** The attacker sets up a rogue DHCP server on a device connected to the network. This can be done using readily available software tools.
2.  **DHCP Discover Broadcast:** A client device on the network broadcasts a DHCP Discover packet when it needs to obtain network configuration (e.g., upon booting up or renewing its IP lease).
3.  **Rogue DHCP Server Response:** The rogue DHCP server, listening for DHCP Discover packets, responds with a DHCP Offer packet. This offer contains attacker-controlled network configuration parameters, such as:
    *   **IP Address:**  Potentially within the legitimate network range or a different range to cause further disruption.
    *   **Subnet Mask:**  May be manipulated to isolate the client or misconfigure the network.
    *   **Default Gateway:**  Set to an attacker-controlled device, allowing for traffic interception.
    *   **DNS Server:**  Set to attacker-controlled DNS servers, enabling DNS spoofing and redirection.
4.  **Client Acceptance:** If the rogue DHCP server's offer reaches the client first or is perceived as more favorable, the client may accept it and send a DHCP Request packet to the rogue server.
5.  **Rogue DHCP Server ACK:** The rogue DHCP server acknowledges the request with a DHCP ACK packet, completing the DHCP handshake and configuring the client with malicious network settings.
6.  **Network Compromise:** The client is now operating with attacker-controlled network settings, enabling various malicious activities.

**Impact:**

*   **Network Redirection:** The attacker can redirect network traffic by controlling the default gateway and DNS server settings provided by the rogue DHCP server. This can lead to users being directed to malicious websites or services.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** By controlling the default gateway, the attacker can position themselves as a Man-in-the-Middle, intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic between the client and the internet or other network resources. This can be used to steal credentials, inject malware, or eavesdrop on sensitive communications.
*   **Data Theft:** Through MitM attacks, the attacker can capture sensitive data transmitted over the network, including login credentials, personal information, and confidential business data.
*   **Denial of Service (Indirect):**  Incorrect or malicious network configurations provided by the rogue DHCP server can disrupt network connectivity for affected clients, leading to a form of DoS.
*   **Further Compromise:** The attacker can leverage the compromised network configuration to further compromise devices on the network, for example, by serving malicious updates or exploiting vulnerabilities in applications through the MitM position.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Secure Network Topology:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Divide the network into smaller, isolated segments (e.g., using VLANs). This limits the impact of a rogue DHCP server to a single segment and prevents it from affecting the entire network.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access control policies to limit physical and logical access to network infrastructure. Restrict who can connect devices to the network and manage network devices.
    *   **Physical Security:** Secure network closets and access points to prevent unauthorized physical access and the introduction of rogue devices.

*   **Implement DHCP Snooping to Detect and Block Rogue DHCP Servers:**
    *   **Mechanism:** As described in the DHCP Starvation mitigation, DHCP snooping is crucial for rogue DHCP server detection and prevention.
    *   **Functionality:** DHCP snooping, when configured with trusted ports pointing only to the legitimate Pi-hole DHCP server, will automatically detect and block DHCP Offer and ACK messages originating from untrusted ports. This effectively prevents rogue DHCP servers from successfully providing network configurations to clients.
    *   **Effectiveness:** DHCP snooping is a highly effective defense against rogue DHCP server attacks, provided it is correctly configured and implemented on network switches.

*   **Ensure Pi-hole DHCP Server is Properly Secured and Authorized within the Network:**
    *   **Strong Passwords and Access Control:** Secure access to the Pi-hole web interface and underlying operating system with strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication where possible. Restrict administrative access to authorized personnel only.
    *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Pi-hole and the underlying operating system updated with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the Pi-hole server itself.
    *   **Disable DHCP Server if Not Needed:** If DHCP services are not required from Pi-hole (e.g., if another dedicated DHCP server is already in place on the network), disable the DHCP server functionality within Pi-hole to eliminate this attack vector entirely.
    *   **DHCP Relay Agent Authorization (Larger Networks):** In larger networks using DHCP relay agents, ensure that only authorized relay agents are configured to forward DHCP requests to the Pi-hole DHCP server. This prevents unauthorized relay agents (potentially controlled by attackers) from directing DHCP traffic to rogue servers.

By implementing these mitigations, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of successful DHCP starvation and rogue DHCP server attacks targeting Pi-hole deployments, ensuring the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of their network services.
