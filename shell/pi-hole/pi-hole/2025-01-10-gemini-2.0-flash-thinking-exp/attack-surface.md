# Attack Surface Analysis for pi-hole/pi-hole

## Attack Surface: [DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/dns_spoofingcache_poisoning.md)

*   **How Pi-hole Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Pi-hole acts as a caching DNS resolver. If vulnerabilities exist in the underlying DNS resolution process (dnsmasq or unbound if configured), attackers could inject false DNS records into Pi-hole's cache.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject a false A record for the application's API server, redirecting user requests to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Users could be redirected to phishing sites, have their credentials stolen, or be served malware. The application's functionality could be severely disrupted.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Pi-hole and its underlying DNS resolver (dnsmasq or unbound) updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Consider enabling DNSSEC on the Pi-hole instance to verify the authenticity of DNS responses (if supported by the upstream resolver).
        *   Monitor Pi-hole logs for suspicious DNS resolution activity.

## Attack Surface: [Web Interface Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/web_interface_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **How Pi-hole Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Pi-hole provides a web interface for administration. Vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism could allow unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability in the web interface's login process to gain administrative access to Pi-hole without valid credentials.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could disable blocking, whitelist malicious domains, modify DNS settings, or potentially gain further access to the underlying system. This directly impacts the application's security posture.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use strong, unique passwords for the Pi-hole web interface.
        *   Enable two-factor authentication (if available or through system-level authentication).
        *   Keep Pi-hole updated to patch any authentication-related vulnerabilities.
        *   Restrict access to the Pi-hole web interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.

## Attack Surface: [Web Interface Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/web_interface_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **How Pi-hole Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The Pi-hole web interface could contain vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject a malicious JavaScript payload into a field within the Pi-hole settings. When an administrator views this page, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could hijack administrator sessions, gain control over the Pi-hole instance through the administrator's browser, or potentially use it as a stepping stone to attack other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Pi-hole updated to patch any XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) on the web interface to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Ensure all user inputs in the web interface are properly sanitized and escaped to prevent script injection.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Issues](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_issues.md)

*   **How Pi-hole Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Pi-hole offers an API for programmatic interaction. Weak or missing authentication/authorization can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** If the API lacks proper authentication, an attacker could send unauthorized requests to disable blocking or retrieve sensitive configuration data.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could bypass Pi-hole's intended functionality, potentially allowing access to blocked content or manipulating DNS settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Pi-hole API requires authentication for sensitive operations.
        *   Implement proper authorization mechanisms to control which users or applications can access specific API endpoints.
        *   If possible, restrict access to the API to trusted sources or networks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanisms.md)

*   **How Pi-hole Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  If the process for updating Pi-hole itself or its blocklists is insecure, attackers could inject malicious code or manipulate the blocklists.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack during an update process, intercepting the download and replacing the legitimate update with a compromised version.
    *   **Impact:** A compromised Pi-hole instance could be used to further attack the application or other systems on the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Pi-hole uses HTTPS for downloading updates and blocklists.
        *   Verify the authenticity of downloaded updates using cryptographic signatures (if available).
        *   Monitor Pi-hole logs for any unusual update activity.
