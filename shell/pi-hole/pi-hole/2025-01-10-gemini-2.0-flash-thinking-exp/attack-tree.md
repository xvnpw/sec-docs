## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Gain unauthorized access to Pi-hole's web interface](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_gain_unauthorized_access_to_pi-hole's_web_interface.md)

This node is critical because it serves as a gateway to numerous malicious actions within Pi-hole. Attackers can leverage this access to modify DNS settings, DHCP configurations, and other crucial parameters.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Brute-force or exploit credentials:** Attackers attempt to guess or crack administrator login credentials using automated tools or known vulnerabilities in the authentication process.
        * **Exploit vulnerabilities in the web interface:**  Attackers exploit weaknesses in the web application code, such as SQL injection, command injection, or authentication bypass flaws, to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Modify Pi-hole's Blocklists](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_modify_pi-hole's_blocklists.md)

This node is critical because manipulating the blocklists allows attackers to directly control which domains are resolved and which are blocked. This can be used to prevent the application from accessing necessary resources or redirect traffic to malicious sites.
    * **Attack Vectors:** This node is typically reached after gaining unauthorized access to the web interface or the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Exploit Pi-hole's Web Interface](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_exploit_pi-hole's_web_interface.md)

This node is critical because the web interface is a primary point of interaction with Pi-hole and often contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited for significant impact.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Pi-hole-Specific Web Interface Vulnerabilities:** Attackers target custom scripts or functionalities within the Pi-hole web interface that may have coding errors or security flaws.
        * **Exploit insecure handling of user input in Pi-hole-specific functionalities:** Attackers provide malicious input to web interface forms or parameters that are not properly sanitized, leading to unintended consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Gain Access to the Underlying System](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_gain_access_to_the_underlying_system.md)

This node is critical because gaining root or administrator access to the server running Pi-hole provides the attacker with complete control over Pi-hole and potentially other services on the same system.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit OS Vulnerabilities:** Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities in the operating system (e.g., Linux kernel exploits, privilege escalation bugs) to gain unauthorized access.
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Other Services:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in other services running on the same server (e.g., SSH, web servers) to gain an initial foothold and then escalate privileges.
        * **Obtain Credentials:** Attackers use various techniques like password cracking, phishing, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to obtain valid system credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Paths: Gain unauthorized access to Pi-hole's web interface -> Modify Pi-hole's Blocklists](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_paths_gain_unauthorized_access_to_pi-hole's_web_interface_-_modify_pi-hole's_blocklists.md)

This path represents a common and impactful attack where attackers first compromise the web interface and then use that access to disrupt the application by blocking its required domains.
    * **Attack Vectors:**  As described above for the "Gain unauthorized access to Pi-hole's web interface" critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Paths: Exploit vulnerabilities in the web interface (e.g., CSRF, XSS specific to Pi-hole functionality)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_paths_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_web_interface__e_g___csrf__xss_specific_to_pi-hole_fu_e702ca99.md)

This path highlights the direct exploitation of web interface vulnerabilities to gain control or perform malicious actions.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Attackers trick an authenticated administrator into making unintended requests on the Pi-hole web interface, such as modifying settings or adding domains to the blocklist.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the Pi-hole web interface, which are then executed by administrators, potentially leading to session hijacking or further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Paths: DNS Spoofing via DHCP](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_paths_dns_spoofing_via_dhcp.md)

This path focuses on the scenario where Pi-hole acts as a DHCP server and attackers exploit this to redirect DNS traffic.
    * **Attack Vectors:** Attackers compromise the Pi-hole DHCP server (often after gaining web interface or system access) and modify DHCP lease configurations to distribute malicious DNS server addresses to clients, including the target application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Paths: Exploit Pi-hole-Specific Web Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_paths_exploit_pi-hole-specific_web_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

This path emphasizes the risk of vulnerabilities within the custom code and functionalities of the Pi-hole web interface.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in custom Pi-hole scripts or pages:** Attackers analyze the source code or behavior of custom Pi-hole web components to find and exploit security flaws.
        * **Exploit insecure handling of user input in Pi-hole-specific functionalities:** Attackers craft malicious input specifically tailored to the unique functionalities of the Pi-hole web interface to trigger vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Paths: Gain Access to the Underlying System](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_paths_gain_access_to_the_underlying_system.md)

This path represents the most severe form of compromise, granting the attacker complete control.
    * **Attack Vectors:** As described above for the "Gain Access to the Underlying System" critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Paths: Session Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_paths_session_hijacking.md)

This path focuses on stealing or intercepting administrator session cookies to impersonate a legitimate user.
    * **Attack Vectors:** Attackers may use techniques like network sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or exploiting XSS vulnerabilities to steal session cookies, allowing them to bypass authentication.
