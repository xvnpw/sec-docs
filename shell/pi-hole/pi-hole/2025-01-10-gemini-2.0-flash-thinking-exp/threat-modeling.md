# Threat Model Analysis for pi-hole/pi-hole

## Threat: [False Negatives Allowing Malicious Domains](./threats/false_negatives_allowing_malicious_domains.md)

*   **Description:** Pi-hole's blocklists are not comprehensive enough or are not updated frequently enough to block newly registered or sophisticated malicious domains.
    *   **Impact:** The application and its users remain vulnerable to threats originating from these unblocked malicious domains, potentially leading to malware infections, phishing attacks, or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Blocklists, Update Mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize multiple reputable and actively maintained blocklists.
        *   Configure Pi-hole to automatically update blocklists regularly.
        *   Consider using additional security layers beyond DNS filtering, such as endpoint security solutions.
        *   Implement threat intelligence feeds to supplement blocklists.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Pi-hole Web Interface](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_pi-hole_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weak credentials or vulnerabilities in the Pi-hole web interface to gain unauthorized access to its settings.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can modify blocklists (whitelisting malicious domains), access query logs for sensitive information, change DNS settings, or even disable Pi-hole entirely, severely compromising the application's security.
    *   **Affected Component:** `lighttpd` (or other web server), PHP modules, Pi-hole web interface scripts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong, unique passwords for the Pi-hole web interface.
        *   Enable and enforce HTTPS for the web interface.
        *   Restrict access to the web interface to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Keep Pi-hole and its dependencies (including the web server and PHP) updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider disabling the web interface if it's not actively needed and manage Pi-hole via the command line interface (CLI).

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web Interface](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the Pi-hole web interface, which are then executed by other users accessing the interface.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can steal administrator session cookies, perform actions on behalf of administrators, or deface the web interface.
    *   **Affected Component:** Pi-hole web interface scripts, `lighttpd` (or other web server).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper input validation and output encoding in the Pi-hole web interface code.
        *   Keep Pi-hole and its dependencies updated to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Pi-hole](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_pi-hole.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the Pi-hole server with a large number of DNS requests, overwhelming its resources and causing it to become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** DNS resolution for the application and its users is disrupted, leading to inability to access internet resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** FTL.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the Pi-hole server or upstream firewall.
        *   Ensure the Pi-hole server has sufficient resources to handle expected traffic.
        *   Consider using DNS caching mechanisms upstream of Pi-hole.

## Threat: [Tampering with Blocklist Update Mechanism](./threats/tampering_with_blocklist_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise the blocklist sources or the update process, injecting malicious entries into the blocklists used by Pi-hole.
    *   **Impact:** Legitimate domains could be blocked, or, more seriously, users could be redirected to malicious websites if attacker-controlled domains are whitelisted or if blocking of malicious infrastructure is removed.
    *   **Affected Component:** Update scripts, Blocklist sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use only reputable and trusted blocklist sources.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded blocklists (e.g., using checksums if provided).
        *   Secure the server where Pi-hole is hosted to prevent unauthorized modification of update scripts.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying System](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_system.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system or software dependencies of the server hosting Pi-hole.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Pi-hole server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or the use of the server for malicious purposes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Operating System, `lighttpd`, `dnsmasq` (or `unbound`), PHP, other installed packages.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the operating system and all software packages up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Harden the operating system by disabling unnecessary services and following security best practices.
        *   Implement a firewall to restrict access to the Pi-hole server.
