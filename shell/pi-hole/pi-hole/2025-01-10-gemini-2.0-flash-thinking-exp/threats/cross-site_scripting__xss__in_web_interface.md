#   - Example of vulnerable code snippet
#   - Example of secure code snippet
#   - Script to test for XSS vulnerabilities

# Example of a potentially vulnerable PHP snippet (illustrative, Pi-hole might use different code):
# Note: This is a simplified example and might not directly reflect Pi-hole's codebase.

# Example of a basic JavaScript snippet to demonstrate XSS:
# <script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>

# In a real analysis, you would point to specific files and lines of code within the Pi-hole repository
# where vulnerabilities might exist and provide concrete examples of how to fix them.
