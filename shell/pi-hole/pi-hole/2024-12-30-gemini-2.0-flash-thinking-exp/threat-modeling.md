Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving Pi-hole:

*   **Threat:** Weak Pi-hole Admin Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to gain access to the Pi-hole web interface by guessing default credentials or using brute-force techniques. Once authenticated, they could modify Pi-hole settings.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete control over DNS filtering for the network, potentially allowing malicious domains, blocking legitimate ones, or redirecting traffic.
    *   **Affected Component:** `/admin` web interface, specifically the authentication module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change the default Pi-hole admin password immediately after installation.
        *   Use a strong, unique password for the Pi-hole admin interface.
        *   Consider enabling two-factor authentication (if available through a plugin or underlying system).
        *   Restrict access to the Pi-hole admin interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.

*   **Threat:** Unsecured Pi-hole Web Interface (HTTP)
    *   **Description:** If the Pi-hole web interface is accessible over unencrypted HTTP, an attacker on the same network could intercept login credentials or session cookies.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Pi-hole admin interface, leading to the same impacts as weak credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** `lighttpd` or `nginx` (web server), specifically the configuration for the `/admin` interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for the Pi-hole web interface. This typically involves installing an SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., using Let's Encrypt) and configuring the web server.
        *   Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Pi-hole API Access
    *   **Description:** If the Pi-hole API is enabled without proper authentication or authorization, an attacker could send malicious requests to control Pi-hole's behavior.
    *   **Impact:**  Remotely disable filtering, add or remove domains from blocklists/whitelists, flush DNS caches, or retrieve DNS query logs.
    *   **Affected Component:** `FTL` (the Pi-hole DNS/DHCP daemon), specifically the API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the API if it's not required.
        *   Implement strong authentication for the API (e.g., API keys).
        *   Restrict API access to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Regularly review and rotate API keys.

*   **Threat:** Blocklist Poisoning/Tampering (If Self-Hosted)
    *   **Description:** If the Pi-hole instance is self-hosted and the underlying system is compromised, an attacker could directly modify the blocklist files.
    *   **Impact:**  Disable blocking of malicious domains or intentionally block legitimate domains, disrupting the application's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying file system where blocklists are stored (e.g., `/etc/pihole/`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the underlying operating system hosting Pi-hole.
        *   Implement strong file permissions for blocklist files.
        *   Regularly monitor the integrity of blocklist files.
        *   Consider using a read-only filesystem for blocklists if feasible.

*   **Threat:** Rogue DHCP Server (If Pi-hole is DHCP Server)
    *   **Description:** If Pi-hole is configured as the DHCP server, an attacker could introduce a rogue DHCP server on the network. This rogue server could provide clients with malicious DNS server addresses, bypassing Pi-hole.
    *   **Impact:**  Clients, including the application's components, could be directed to malicious DNS servers, negating Pi-hole's filtering and potentially leading to malware infections or phishing attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `FTL` (DHCP server functionality).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   If Pi-hole is acting as the DHCP server, implement port security on network switches to prevent unauthorized DHCP servers.
        *   Use DHCP snooping on network devices to validate DHCP messages.
        *   Regularly monitor the network for rogue DHCP servers.
        *   Consider disabling the DHCP server on Pi-hole if another trusted DHCP server is available.
