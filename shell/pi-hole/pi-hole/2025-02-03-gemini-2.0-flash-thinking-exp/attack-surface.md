# Attack Surface Analysis for pi-hole/pi-hole

## Attack Surface: [Web Application Vulnerabilities in Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/web_application_vulnerabilities_in_admin_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable weaknesses within Pi-hole's web-based administration interface (PHP code, lighttpd configuration, and related dependencies). These vulnerabilities can be leveraged by attackers to compromise the Pi-hole system or the browsers of administrators managing it.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** Pi-hole *directly provides* and relies on this web interface as the primary management tool. Vulnerabilities within this interface are a direct attack surface of Pi-hole itself.
*   **Example:** A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Pi-hole settings page allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript. When a Pi-hole administrator accesses this page through their browser, the injected script executes, potentially stealing their session cookie. This allows the attacker to hijack the administrator's session and gain full control over the Pi-hole web interface.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Pi-hole system, unauthorized and persistent modification of DNS blocking settings, circumvention of ad-blocking, exposure of network traffic statistics, potential for denial of service, and if Pi-hole is a critical network component, wider network disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Rigorous input validation and output encoding in all PHP code to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
        *   Implementation of robust Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection using anti-CSRF tokens.
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all administrative functions.
        *   Maintain up-to-date PHP and all web interface dependencies, promptly patching any identified vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement and enforce security-focused HTTP headers in the lighttpd configuration (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy).
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the Pi-hole web interface.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep Pi-hole software updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for the web interface.
        *   Restrict access to the web interface to only trusted users and networks. Consider using a VPN for remote access.
        *   Regularly review Pi-hole settings for any unauthorized or unexpected changes.

## Attack Surface: [DNS Resolver (dnsmasq) Vulnerabilities in Pi-hole Context](./attack_surfaces/dns_resolver__dnsmasq__vulnerabilities_in_pi-hole_context.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable security vulnerabilities within the `dnsmasq` DNS resolver *as utilized by Pi-hole*. While `dnsmasq` vulnerabilities are general, their impact is amplified in the context of Pi-hole as it's the core DNS service for the network.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** Pi-hole *integrates and relies* on `dnsmasq` as its primary DNS resolver.  Any vulnerability in `dnsmasq` directly impacts Pi-hole's core functionality and security. Pi-hole's configuration and usage patterns of `dnsmasq` can also influence the exploitability or impact of these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in `dnsmasq`'s handling of specific DNS query types. An attacker on the network or internet sends crafted DNS queries to the Pi-hole instance. Due to the vulnerability in `dnsmasq`, processing these queries allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Pi-hole system, potentially gaining full system control.
*   **Impact:** Denial of DNS resolution service for the entire network relying on Pi-hole, remote code execution on the Pi-hole system leading to full system compromise, network-wide disruption, and potential data breaches if the attacker pivots to other systems on the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Maintain `dnsmasq` at the latest stable version, ensuring timely application of all security patches.
        *   Actively monitor security advisories related to `dnsmasq` and promptly address any reported vulnerabilities within Pi-hole updates.
        *   Consider applying hardening configurations to `dnsmasq` within Pi-hole's default setup to reduce the attack surface where feasible.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Crucially, keep Pi-hole updated to the latest version, as updates frequently include patched versions of `dnsmasq`.
        *   Monitor Pi-hole and the underlying system for any unusual behavior or crashes that could indicate exploitation attempts against `dnsmasq`.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the potential blast radius if the Pi-hole system is compromised through a `dnsmasq` vulnerability.

## Attack Surface: [FTL Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/ftl_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present within the FTL (Faster Than Light) engine, Pi-hole's custom-built C++ core component. These flaws can be exploited to compromise the Pi-hole system's stability, security, and functionality.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** FTL is a *unique and essential component* of Pi-hole, handling core DNS processing and data management. Vulnerabilities within FTL are a direct and specific attack surface introduced by Pi-hole's architecture.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FTL's processing of DNS blocklist data. If a specially crafted blocklist is loaded into Pi-hole, FTL attempts to process it, triggering the buffer overflow. This could lead to a crash of the FTL engine (denial of service) or, in a more severe scenario, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Pi-hole system.
*   **Impact:** Denial of DNS service due to FTL engine crashes, potential remote code execution on the Pi-hole system leading to full compromise, data corruption within Pi-hole's internal data structures, and overall instability of the Pi-hole service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Employ rigorous secure coding practices in C++ development for FTL, with a strong focus on memory safety to prevent buffer overflows, use-after-free, and similar vulnerabilities.
        *   Conduct thorough code reviews and utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities in FTL code.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data processed by FTL, including DNS queries, blocklists, and configuration data.
        *   Utilize memory safety tools and compiler-level security features (ASLR, Stack Canaries) during the build process for FTL.
        *   Establish a process for rapid security vulnerability response and release timely security patches for FTL.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Maintain Pi-hole updates to ensure you have the latest FTL version with security patches.
        *   Monitor Pi-hole's performance and logs for any unusual behavior or crashes that might indicate issues with FTL.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Issues Leading to System Modification](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_issues_leading_to_system_modification.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or absent authentication and authorization controls for the Pi-hole API, enabling unauthorized access to API endpoints that can modify Pi-hole's configuration and operational state.
*   **Pi-hole Contribution:** Pi-hole *provides* an API for programmatic access to its functionalities. Insufficient security around this API directly creates a pathway for unauthorized manipulation of Pi-hole.
*   **Example:** The Pi-hole API is enabled, and while an API key is used, it is easily guessable or exposed (e.g., default key, insecure storage). An attacker gains access to this API key and uses it to access API endpoints that allow modification of Pi-hole's blocklists, whitelists, or DNS settings. This could be used to disable ad-blocking, inject malicious domains into the whitelist, or redirect traffic.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of Pi-hole's core settings, bypassing of ad-blocking, potential redirection of network traffic to malicious sites by manipulating DNS records, information disclosure through API access, and potential for denial of service by misconfiguring Pi-hole via the API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Enforce strong, randomly generated API keys by default.
        *   Provide clear guidance and warnings to users about the importance of securing API keys and not exposing them.
        *   Consider implementing more robust authentication methods beyond API keys in future versions, such as token-based authentication or user-based access control.
        *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks on API keys and prevent denial of service.
        *   Thoroughly document API security considerations and best practices for users.
    *   **Users:**
        *   If using the API, ensure the API key is strong, randomly generated, and kept secret. Do not expose it in publicly accessible locations (e.g., client-side code, public repositories).
        *   Restrict network access to the API endpoint to only trusted networks or systems.
        *   Regularly review API access logs for any suspicious or unauthorized activity.
        *   Disable the API entirely if it is not actively being used.
