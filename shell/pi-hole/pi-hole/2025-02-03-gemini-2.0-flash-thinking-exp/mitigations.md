# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pi-hole/pi-hole

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Redundant Pi-hole Instance (Configuration Synchronization)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_redundant_pi-hole_instance__configuration_synchronization_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Redundant Pi-hole Instance (Configuration Synchronization)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  Provision a secondary server or virtual machine for Pi-hole.
        2.  Install Pi-hole on the secondary server.
        3.  **Synchronize blocklists and whitelist configurations between the primary and secondary Pi-hole instances.** This can be achieved through:
            *   **Scripting:** Develop scripts to export blocklists and whitelists from the primary Pi-hole (using `pihole -g -l` and parsing `/etc/pihole/whitelist.txt`, `/etc/pihole/blacklist.txt`, etc.) and import them to the secondary Pi-hole. Automate this script execution on a schedule or upon configuration changes.
            *   **Configuration Management Tools:** Utilize tools like Ansible or Puppet to manage Pi-hole configurations across instances, ensuring consistency in blocklists and whitelists.
            *   **Pi-hole Teleporter:** Use Pi-hole's built-in Teleporter feature to create backups of the primary Pi-hole's configuration and restore them on the secondary instance. Automate this process.
        4.  Configure your application's DNS settings to use both Pi-hole instances (primary and secondary).
        5.  Regularly verify configuration synchronization and test failover by switching DNS resolution between instances.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Single Point of Failure (Severity: High) - If the primary Pi-hole fails, DNS resolution for the application is disrupted. Redundancy mitigates this by providing a backup.
        *   Configuration Drift (Severity: Medium) - Inconsistent configurations between Pi-hole instances can lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistent blocking. Synchronization ensures consistent filtering.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Single Point of Failure: Significantly Reduced - Redundancy ensures DNS resolution even if one Pi-hole instance is unavailable.
        *   Configuration Drift: Significantly Reduced - Configuration synchronization ensures consistent blocking behavior across Pi-hole instances.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Assuming a hypothetical project). Configuration management or scripting for Pi-hole configuration synchronization might be missing.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Scripting or configuration management for Pi-hole configuration synchronization, Automation of configuration updates between Pi-hole instances.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Pi-hole Health Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/regular_pi-hole_health_monitoring.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Pi-hole Health Monitoring
    *   **Description:**
        1.  Utilize tools to monitor the Pi-hole service and server resources. This can include:
            *   **Pi-hole's built-in API:** Use Pi-hole's API (`/admin/api.php`) to retrieve metrics like `queries_blocked`, `ads_percentage_today`, `dns_queries_today`, and system load.
            *   **System Monitoring Tools:** Employ system monitoring agents (like Prometheus exporters, Telegraf) to collect server-level metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic related to Pi-hole processes (`pihole-FTL`, `lighttpd`).
        2.  Set up a monitoring dashboard to visualize these Pi-hole specific metrics.
        3.  Configure alerts based on thresholds for Pi-hole metrics. For example:
            *   Alert if `pihole-FTL` service is down.
            *   Alert if DNS resolution time (measured via pinging through Pi-hole) exceeds a threshold.
            *   Alert if CPU or memory usage on the Pi-hole server is consistently high.
        4.  Regularly review monitoring data to identify performance trends and potential issues with Pi-hole.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unnoticed Pi-hole Failure (Severity: High) - If Pi-hole fails without monitoring, application functionality relying on DNS filtering will be broken without immediate awareness.
        *   Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium) - Slow DNS resolution due to overloaded Pi-hole can degrade application performance. Monitoring helps detect performance issues early.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unnoticed Pi-hole Failure: Significantly Reduced - Continuous monitoring and alerting ensure immediate detection of Pi-hole failures.
        *   Performance Degradation: Moderately Reduced - Monitoring performance metrics allows for proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Assuming a hypothetical project). Basic server monitoring might be in place, but Pi-hole specific metrics and alerts might be missing.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Integration of Pi-hole API or system monitoring for Pi-hole specific metrics, Configuration of alerts based on Pi-hole health metrics, Pi-hole specific dashboard in monitoring system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strategic Blocklist and Whitelist Management](./mitigation_strategies/strategic_blocklist_and_whitelist_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strategic Blocklist and Whitelist Management
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Curate Blocklists:** Carefully select blocklists within Pi-hole's web interface or configuration files.
            *   Start with recommended and reputable blocklists.
            *   Regularly review and prune blocklists that are outdated or overly aggressive.
            *   Consider using category-specific blocklists to fine-tune blocking.
        2.  **Implement Whitelisting Process:** Establish a clear process for adding domains to Pi-hole's whitelist.
            *   Use Pi-hole's web interface or `pihole -w` command to add whitelisted domains.
            *   Document the reason for each whitelisted domain.
            *   Regularly review and remove unnecessary whitelisted domains.
        3.  **Testing Blocklist Changes:** Before applying significant blocklist changes in production, test them in a staging Pi-hole environment.
            *   Use Pi-hole's Teleporter to export/import configurations between staging and production.
            *   Monitor application behavior in staging after blocklist updates.
        4.  **Version Control Blocklists/Whitelists:** Consider version controlling Pi-hole's blocklist and whitelist configurations (e.g., using Git to track changes in `/etc/pihole/adlists.list`, `/etc/pihole/whitelist.txt`, `/etc/pihole/blacklist.txt`).
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   False Positives Blocking Legitimate Resources (Severity: Medium) - Overly aggressive blocklists can block domains required for application functionality. Strategic management minimizes this.
        *   Application Downtime due to Incorrect Blocking (Severity: Medium) - Blocking critical application dependencies can lead to downtime. Testing and whitelisting reduce this risk.
        *   Security Bypass due to Ineffective Blocklists (Severity: Low) - Outdated blocklists may fail to block new threats. Regular updates and curation improve blocking effectiveness.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   False Positives Blocking Legitimate Resources: Significantly Reduced - Careful selection, testing, and whitelisting minimize false positives.
        *   Application Downtime due to Incorrect Blocking: Moderately Reduced - Testing and controlled rollout of blocklists reduce the risk of production downtime.
        *   Security Bypass due to Ineffective Blocklists: Moderately Reduced - Regular updates and review of blocklists improve blocking effectiveness.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Blocklists and whitelists are likely used in Pi-hole, but formal management and testing processes might be missing. Blocklist/whitelist configuration is usually done directly in Pi-hole.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Staging environment for Pi-hole testing, Formal whitelisting process documentation, Version control for Pi-hole blocklist/whitelist configurations, Automated testing of blocklist changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Pi-hole Web Interface Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_pi-hole_web_interface_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Pi-hole Web Interface Access
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Strong Password:** Change the default password for the Pi-hole web interface immediately through the web interface settings or using `pihole -a -p`. Use a strong, unique password.
        2.  **Enable HTTPS:** Enable HTTPS for the Pi-hole web interface using `pihole -r` (reconfigure) and selecting the HTTPS option. This will guide you through setting up HTTPS, potentially using Let's Encrypt for free certificates.
        3.  **Restrict Interface Binding:** Configure Pi-hole's web interface to bind only to specific network interfaces or IP addresses using the `INTERFACE` setting in `/etc/pihole/setupVars.conf`. This limits accessibility to the web interface.
        4.  **Disable Public Web Interface (If Not Needed):** If remote web interface access is not required, disable it entirely through Pi-hole's settings or by configuring firewall rules to block access to ports 80/443 on the Pi-hole server from external networks.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Pi-hole Configuration (Severity: High) - Unsecured web interface allows attackers to modify Pi-hole settings, disable blocking, or redirect DNS traffic.
        *   Data Breach of Pi-hole Credentials (Severity: Medium) - Weak or default passwords can be easily compromised. HTTPS protects credentials in transit.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Severity: Medium) - Without HTTPS, communication with the web interface is vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Pi-hole Configuration: Significantly Reduced - Strong passwords, HTTPS, and interface binding make unauthorized access much harder.
        *   Data Breach of Pi-hole Credentials: Significantly Reduced - Strong passwords and HTTPS reduce the risk of credential compromise.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Significantly Reduced - HTTPS encrypts communication, preventing eavesdropping and manipulation.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Password change is likely recommended, but HTTPS and interface binding might be missing. Web interface security is configured directly on the Pi-hole server.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Enabling HTTPS for web interface, Restricting web interface binding to specific interfaces, Disabling public web interface access if not required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Pi-hole Software and Blocklist Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_pi-hole_software_and_blocklist_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Pi-hole Software and Blocklist Updates
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Automate Pi-hole Software Updates:** Configure automated updates for Pi-hole software using `cron` jobs or systemd timers to run `pihole -up` regularly (e.g., weekly).
        2.  **Enable Automatic Blocklist Updates:** Ensure "Update ad lists automatically" is enabled in Pi-hole's web interface settings (Settings -> Update) and configure a suitable update frequency (e.g., daily or weekly).
        3.  **Staged Updates (Testing):** Before automatically applying updates to production, consider a staged update approach:
            *   Update a staging Pi-hole instance first.
            *   Monitor the staging environment for any issues after the update.
            *   If no issues are found, proceed with updating production Pi-hole instances.
        4.  **Monitor Update Process:** Monitor the logs for `pihole -up` and blocklist update processes to ensure updates are successful and without errors.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exploitation of Known Pi-hole Vulnerabilities (Severity: High) - Outdated software may contain known security vulnerabilities. Regular updates patch these.
        *   Bypass of Blocking due to Outdated Blocklists (Severity: Medium) - Outdated blocklists may not block new threats. Regular updates improve blocking effectiveness.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exploitation of Known Pi-hole Vulnerabilities: Significantly Reduced - Regular updates patch known vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of exploitation.
        *   Bypass of Blocking due to Outdated Blocklists: Moderately Reduced - Regular blocklist updates improve blocking effectiveness against new threats.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Pi-hole has built-in update mechanisms, but automated testing and staged rollouts might be missing. Software updates are managed on the Pi-hole server itself.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Automation of Pi-hole software updates (using cron/systemd), Staging environment for Pi-hole updates, Automated testing of updates in staging, Formal update management process.
