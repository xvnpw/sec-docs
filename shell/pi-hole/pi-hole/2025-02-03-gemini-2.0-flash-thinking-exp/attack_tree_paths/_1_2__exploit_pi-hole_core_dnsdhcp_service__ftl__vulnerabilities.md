### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2] Vulnerabilities in DHCP Server (if enabled)

This section provides a detailed analysis of each node within the attack path **[1.2.2] Vulnerabilities in DHCP Server (if enabled)**.

#### 4.1. [1.2.2] Vulnerabilities in DHCP Server (if enabled)

**Description:**

This node represents the general attack vector of exploiting vulnerabilities within Pi-hole's DHCP server functionality. This attack path is only relevant if the Pi-hole instance is configured to act as a DHCP server for the network. If DHCP is disabled in Pi-hole and another device on the network is handling DHCP, this attack path is not directly applicable to Pi-hole's DHCP service. However, a compromised Pi-hole could still be leveraged to facilitate network attacks even if its DHCP server is disabled (though not through *DHCP server vulnerabilities* specifically).

**Technical Details:**

Pi-hole utilizes `dnsmasq` as its underlying DHCP and DNS server.  Vulnerabilities in `dnsmasq` itself, or in Pi-hole's configuration and management of `dnsmasq` for DHCP, could be exploited. These vulnerabilities could range from software bugs leading to crashes or unexpected behavior to misconfigurations allowing for malicious actions.

**Potential Impact:**

Successful exploitation of DHCP server vulnerabilities could lead to:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Making the DHCP server unavailable, preventing devices from obtaining IP addresses and network connectivity.
*   **Network Misconfiguration:**  Forcing clients to receive incorrect network settings, leading to traffic redirection, DNS poisoning, or other malicious activities.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Potentially leaking DHCP server configuration or client information.
*   **Remote Code Execution (in severe cases):**  Exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities in the DHCP server software to execute arbitrary code on the Pi-hole system (less likely in typical DHCP attacks, but theoretically possible with severe vulnerabilities).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Keep Pi-hole and `dnsmasq` Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Pi-hole to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities in `dnsmasq` and Pi-hole's management scripts.
*   **Minimize DHCP Server Exposure:**  Ensure the Pi-hole DHCP server is only accessible from the intended network segment. Firewall rules and network segmentation can help limit exposure.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review Pi-hole's configuration and logs for any suspicious activity related to the DHCP server.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to Low.  Exploitable vulnerabilities in well-maintained software like `dnsmasq` are less frequent, but not impossible. Misconfigurations are more common.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High.  Depending on the vulnerability and the attacker's goals, the impact can range from temporary network disruption to more serious security breaches.

#### 4.2. [1.2.2.a] DHCP Starvation to cause DoS [HIGH RISK]

**Description:**

DHCP starvation is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that aims to exhaust the DHCP server's address pool. By sending a flood of DHCP request packets with spoofed MAC addresses, an attacker can consume all available IP addresses, preventing legitimate devices from obtaining leases and joining the network.

**Technical Details:**

1.  **DHCP Process:**  When a device joins a network and is configured to obtain an IP address automatically (DHCP client), it broadcasts a DHCP Discover message.
2.  **DHCP Server Response:** The DHCP server, upon receiving a Discover message, checks its address pool and offers an available IP address to the client in a DHCP Offer message.
3.  **DHCP Request and ACK:** The client then responds with a DHCP Request message to accept the offered IP, and the server confirms with a DHCP ACK (Acknowledgement) message, completing the lease process.
4.  **Starvation Attack:** In a DHCP starvation attack, the attacker sends a large number of DHCP Discover messages with rapidly changing, spoofed MAC addresses. The DHCP server, believing these are legitimate requests, allocates IP addresses from its pool for each request.
5.  **Pool Exhaustion:** If the attacker sends enough requests, they can exhaust the entire DHCP address pool. Once the pool is empty, the DHCP server cannot assign IP addresses to new legitimate devices attempting to join the network.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Network-wide Denial of Service:**  New devices cannot connect to the network. Existing devices with expiring leases may also lose connectivity if they cannot renew their leases.
*   **Disruption of Services:**  Network services become unavailable as devices lose IP addresses and network access.
*   **Operational Downtime:**  Requires manual intervention to diagnose and resolve the issue, leading to downtime.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **DHCP Snooping (Network Switch Feature):**  Enable DHCP snooping on network switches. This security feature filters DHCP messages and only allows DHCP server responses from trusted ports, preventing rogue DHCP servers and mitigating starvation attacks by limiting the source of DHCP requests.
*   **Port Security (Network Switch Feature):**  Implement port security on switch ports to limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned on a port. This can restrict the attacker's ability to generate a large number of spoofed MAC addresses from a single port.
*   **Rate Limiting on DHCP Server:**  Configure rate limiting on the Pi-hole DHCP server to limit the number of DHCP requests processed within a specific time frame. This can slow down the attacker's ability to exhaust the address pool. (Note: Pi-hole/`dnsmasq` configuration options for rate limiting should be investigated).
*   **Increase DHCP Address Pool Size:**  While not a direct mitigation, increasing the DHCP address pool size can make it harder for an attacker to exhaust it quickly, buying time for detection and response. However, this is not a robust long-term solution.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Segment the network into smaller VLANs. This limits the scope of a DHCP starvation attack to a single VLAN, preventing it from affecting the entire network.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy IDS/IPS systems capable of detecting and blocking DHCP starvation attacks by monitoring DHCP traffic patterns.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  DHCP starvation attacks are relatively easy to execute with readily available tools. The likelihood depends on the network's exposure and the presence of security measures.
*   **Impact:** High.  A successful DHCP starvation attack can cause significant network disruption and denial of service.

**Pi-hole Specific Considerations:**

*   Pi-hole itself, if compromised, could be used to launch a DHCP starvation attack against its own network or other networks.
*   If Pi-hole is deployed in a network without DHCP snooping or port security, it is more vulnerable to DHCP starvation attacks.

#### 4.3. [1.2.2.b] Rogue DHCP Server attack (if Pi-hole is not properly secured in the network) - *Less Pi-hole specific, more network config* [HIGH RISK]

**Description:**

A rogue DHCP server attack involves introducing an unauthorized DHCP server onto the network. This malicious server can respond to DHCP requests from clients, providing them with incorrect network configurations, such as a malicious gateway or DNS server. This allows the attacker to intercept network traffic, perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, and potentially redirect users to phishing sites or distribute malware.

**Technical Details:**

1.  **DHCP Server Discovery:** DHCP clients broadcast DHCP Discover messages to find DHCP servers on the network.
2.  **Rogue Server Response:** A rogue DHCP server, if present, will also respond to these Discover messages with DHCP Offer messages.
3.  **Race Condition:**  Clients typically accept the first DHCP Offer they receive. If the rogue DHCP server responds faster than the legitimate DHCP server (or if the legitimate server is unavailable or slow), clients may accept the rogue server's offer.
4.  **Malicious Configuration:** The rogue DHCP server can provide clients with:
    *   **Incorrect IP Address:**  Potentially causing IP address conflicts or network segmentation issues.
    *   **Malicious Gateway:**  Redirecting all client traffic through the attacker's machine, enabling MitM attacks.
    *   **Malicious DNS Server:**  Poisoning DNS resolution, redirecting users to fake websites or preventing access to legitimate sites.
    *   **Short Lease Times:**  Forcing frequent DHCP renewals, increasing the attacker's control and persistence.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  Interception and manipulation of network traffic, including sensitive data.
*   **DNS Poisoning/Redirection:**  Redirecting users to malicious websites for phishing, malware distribution, or information theft.
*   **Data Theft:**  Stealing credentials, personal information, or other sensitive data transmitted over the network.
*   **Malware Distribution:**  Injecting malware into network traffic or redirecting users to malware download sites.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  Compromising the security pillars of the network.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **DHCP Snooping (Network Switch Feature):**  DHCP snooping is the primary defense against rogue DHCP servers. It prevents unauthorized DHCP server responses from reaching clients by only allowing DHCP server traffic from trusted ports (ports connected to legitimate DHCP servers).
*   **Port Security (Network Switch Feature):**  While less directly related to rogue DHCP servers, port security can help limit the impact of a compromised device acting as a rogue server by restricting the number of MAC addresses and potentially the type of traffic originating from a port.
*   **Network Segmentation (VLANs):**  Segmenting the network into VLANs can limit the scope of a rogue DHCP server attack. A rogue server on one VLAN will not directly affect clients on other VLANs (unless routing is misconfigured).
*   **Physical Security:**  Secure network infrastructure devices (switches, routers, Pi-hole server) to prevent unauthorized physical access and the introduction of rogue devices.
*   **Regular Network Monitoring and Audits:**  Monitor network traffic for unexpected DHCP server activity. Regularly audit network configurations and device inventories to detect unauthorized devices.
*   **DHCP Server Authorization (Enterprise Environments):** In larger enterprise networks, DHCP server authorization mechanisms can be used to ensure only authorized DHCP servers are allowed to operate. (Less relevant for typical Pi-hole home/small office setups).

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  Introducing a rogue DHCP server is relatively straightforward if physical access to the network is gained or if a compromised device within the network can be used. The likelihood is higher in less secured networks.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical.  A successful rogue DHCP server attack can have severe consequences, leading to widespread compromise of network security and user data.

**Pi-hole Specific Considerations:**

*   If a Pi-hole instance is compromised, it could be turned into a rogue DHCP server to attack the network it is connected to.
*   If Pi-hole is deployed in a network without DHCP snooping or other rogue DHCP server mitigation measures, it is vulnerable to this type of attack, regardless of whether Pi-hole itself is compromised or not (if another attacker introduces a rogue DHCP server).
*   Proper network configuration and security practices are crucial to mitigate rogue DHCP server attacks, even when using Pi-hole for DHCP.
