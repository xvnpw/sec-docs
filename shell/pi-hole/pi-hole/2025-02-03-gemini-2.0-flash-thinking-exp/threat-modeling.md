# Threat Model Analysis for pi-hole/pi-hole

## Threat: [Pi-hole Service Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/pi-hole_service_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Pi-hole server with a large volume of DNS queries, overwhelming its resources and causing it to become unresponsive to legitimate DNS requests.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime due to DNS resolution failures, inability to access external services.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** `dnsmasq`/`unbound` (DNS resolver), Pi-hole server infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on incoming DNS queries at the firewall or network level.
    *   Ensure sufficient server resources for Pi-hole.
    *   Utilize network intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

## Threat: [Pi-hole Configuration Tampering via Web Interface](./threats/pi-hole_configuration_tampering_via_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Pi-hole web interface and modifies settings to disable blocking, whitelist malicious domains, blacklist legitimate domains, or change upstream DNS servers to malicious resolvers.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security filtering, redirection to malicious sites, denial of service to legitimate services, potential malware exposure.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** Pi-hole Web Interface, Configuration files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for the web interface.
    *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) if possible.
    *   Restrict web interface access to authorized users and networks.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and access permissions.
    *   Keep Pi-hole software updated.

## Threat: [Blocklist/Whitelist Manipulation via File System Access](./threats/blocklistwhitelist_manipulation_via_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized file system access to the Pi-hole server and directly modifies blocklist and whitelist files to weaken blocking or disrupt legitimate services.
*   **Impact:** Reduced ad-blocking effectiveness, bypassing security filtering, potential exposure to malicious content, disruption of application functionality.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** Blocklist files, Whitelist files, File system permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure server access and harden the operating system.
    *   Implement strict file system permissions.
    *   Regularly audit file system permissions and access logs.
    *   Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

## Threat: [DNS Cache Poisoning via Upstream Resolver Vulnerability](./threats/dns_cache_poisoning_via_upstream_resolver_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the upstream DNS resolver used by Pi-hole, poisoning its cache. Pi-hole then receives and caches these malicious DNS records, serving them to your application.
*   **Impact:** Redirection of application traffic to malicious websites, man-in-the-middle attacks, data theft, application malfunction.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** Upstream DNS resolvers, DNS cache within Pi-hole (indirectly).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use reputable and security-focused upstream DNS resolvers.
    *   Enable DNSSEC validation if supported by upstream resolvers.
    *   Keep Pi-hole and upstream resolvers updated with security patches.
    *   Monitor DNS resolution patterns for anomalies.

## Threat: [Compromised Pi-hole Updates via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)](./threats/compromised_pi-hole_updates_via_man-in-the-middle__mitm_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts Pi-hole updates during download via a Man-in-the-Middle attack and replaces them with malicious updates containing malware.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise of the Pi-hole server, malware installation, potential network compromise.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** Pi-hole update mechanism, Network connection to update servers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Pi-hole update process uses HTTPS.
    *   Verify updates are downloaded from official and trusted sources.
    *   Implement or verify checksum/signature verification for updates.
    *   Test updates in a non-production environment first.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Pi-hole Dependencies (OS, Web Server, PHP, `dnsmasq`/`unbound`)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_pi-hole_dependencies__os__web_server__php___dnsmasq__unbound__.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in underlying software components used by Pi-hole (operating system, web server, PHP, DNS resolver) are exploited to compromise the Pi-hole system.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, denial of service, information disclosure, elevation of privilege.
*   **Affected Pi-hole Component:** Underlying operating system, Web server, PHP, `dnsmasq`/`unbound`, system libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the operating system and all Pi-hole dependencies updated with security patches.
    *   Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in the Pi-hole environment.
    *   Harden the operating system and web server.
    *   Minimize unnecessary software components on the Pi-hole server.
