9.  **Conclusion and Recommendations:** Summarize the findings and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

### 2. Threat Model Review

The identified threats are accurate and relevant to DNS security:

*   **DNS Eavesdropping:**  An attacker on the network path between the Pi-hole and the upstream DNS server can passively observe DNS queries, revealing the websites and services a user is accessing.  This is a significant privacy violation.  (Severity: **High**)
*   **DNS Tampering/Hijacking (MitM):** An attacker can intercept and modify DNS responses, redirecting the user to malicious websites (e.g., phishing sites) or blocking access to legitimate services.  This can lead to data theft, malware infection, or censorship. (Severity: **High**)
*   **Reliance on Untrusted Local Resolvers:**  The user's ISP or local network may provide a DNS resolver that is unreliable, insecure, or subject to censorship.  This undermines the user's control over their DNS resolution. (Severity: **Medium**)

The severity ratings are appropriate.

### 3. Technical Mechanism Analysis

**How DoH and DoT Work:**

Both DoH and DoT aim to secure DNS communication by encrypting the queries and responses between the client (Pi-hole) and the upstream DNS server.  They differ in their implementation:

*   **DNS over HTTPS (DoH):**  Encapsulates DNS queries within standard HTTPS traffic (port 443).  This makes it look like regular web browsing, making it harder to detect and block.  It leverages the existing TLS/SSL infrastructure for encryption and authentication.  The DNS query is sent as an HTTP request, and the response is an HTTP response.

*   **DNS over TLS (DoT):**  Uses a dedicated port (port 853) for encrypted DNS communication.  It establishes a TLS connection directly, without the HTTP layer of DoH.  This can be slightly more efficient but is also easier to identify and block.

**Key Security Features:**

*   **Encryption:**  Both DoH and DoT use TLS to encrypt the communication channel, preventing eavesdropping.  The content of the DNS queries and responses is hidden from intermediaries.
*   **Authentication:**  TLS provides server authentication.  The Pi-hole verifies the identity of the upstream DNS server using its TLS certificate, ensuring it's communicating with the legitimate server and not an imposter.  This prevents MitM attacks.
*   **Integrity:** TLS also ensures data integrity. Any modification of the DNS data during transit would be detected, preventing tampering.

### 4. Implementation Review (Pi-hole)

The described Pi-hole implementation steps are generally straightforward:

1.  **Access Pi-hole Web Interface:** Standard access method.
2.  **Login:**  Essential security measure.  The strength of the Pi-hole password is a critical factor here.
3.  **Navigate to Settings:**  Clear navigation.
4.  **Select DNS Tab:**  Logical organization.
5.  **Choose Upstream DNS Servers:**  Pi-hole provides pre-configured options, which simplifies the process for many users.  The option to enter custom addresses allows for flexibility.  The emphasis on DoH/DoT providers is crucial.
6.  **Enable DoH/DoT:**  This is the key step.  The clarity of this option (dropdown or checkbox) and the requirement for the DoH/DoT endpoint URL are important usability considerations.  If the UI is unclear, users might misconfigure it.
7.  **Save Changes:**  Standard procedure.
8.  **Test:**  Essential to ensure the configuration is working correctly.

**Potential Weaknesses:**

*   **User Error:**  The most significant potential weakness is user error during configuration.  Entering an incorrect endpoint URL, choosing a non-DoH/DoT server, or failing to enable DoH/DoT would negate the security benefits.
*   **Default Settings:**  If the default settings do not prioritize DoH/DoT, users might not change them.

### 5. Provider Selection Analysis

Choosing a reputable DoH/DoT provider is paramount.  The mitigation strategy correctly mentions Cloudflare, Google, and Quad9, which are generally considered trustworthy.  Key criteria for selection include:

*   **Privacy Policy:**  The provider's privacy policy should clearly state how they handle DNS data.  Ideally, they should have a no-logging policy or minimal logging for operational purposes only.
*   **Security Practices:**  The provider should have a strong track record of security and employ robust infrastructure to protect against attacks.
*   **Transparency:**  The provider should be transparent about their operations and any potential data sharing with third parties.
*   **Performance and Reliability:**  The provider should offer fast and reliable DNS resolution.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The legal jurisdiction in which the provider operates can impact data privacy and security.

**Residual Risks:**

Even with a trusted DoH/DoT provider, some residual risks remain:

*   **Provider Compromise:**  While unlikely, a major provider could be compromised, potentially exposing DNS data.
*   **Metadata Leakage:**  While the content of DNS queries is encrypted, the fact that the Pi-hole is communicating with a specific DoH/DoT provider is still visible.  This could reveal that the user is using Pi-hole and a particular DNS provider.
*   **Government Surveillance:**  In some jurisdictions, governments may have the legal authority to compel DoH/DoT providers to hand over data, even if the provider has a no-logging policy.
*   **DoH/DoT Blocking:**  Some networks or ISPs may attempt to block DoH/DoT traffic, forcing users to fall back to unencrypted DNS.

### 6. Missing Implementation Analysis

The identified "Missing Implementation" points are crucial for enhancing the security and usability of DoH/DoT in Pi-hole:

*   **Automatic DoH/DoT Fallback:**
    *   **Importance:**  If the configured DoH/DoT server becomes unavailable, Pi-hole should have a secure fallback mechanism.  The worst-case scenario is falling back to unencrypted DNS without informing the user.
    *   **Solution:**  Implement a prioritized list of DoH/DoT servers.  If the primary server fails, Pi-hole should automatically try the next server on the list.  If all DoH/DoT servers fail, Pi-hole should either:
        *   **Fail Closed:**  Stop resolving DNS queries and display a clear error message to the user, preventing unencrypted DNS resolution.
        *   **Fail Secure (with warning):**  Attempt to use a pre-configured, trusted, but *unencrypted* DNS server (e.g., a known public resolver) *only after* displaying a prominent warning to the user about the reduced security.  This option should be configurable.
    *   **Implementation Details:**  This requires robust error handling and connection testing within Pi-hole.  The fallback mechanism should be configurable by the user.

*   **Simplified DoH/DoT Configuration:**
    *   **Importance:**  Entering DoH/DoT endpoint URLs can be error-prone and intimidating for non-technical users.
    *   **Solution:**  Expand the list of pre-configured DoH/DoT providers within the Pi-hole interface.  For each provider, automatically populate the correct endpoint URL when the user selects the provider.  This eliminates the need for manual URL entry in most cases.
    *   **Implementation Details:**  Maintain an up-to-date list of popular DoH/DoT providers and their endpoint URLs within Pi-hole.  Provide a mechanism to update this list automatically.

*   **DoH/DoT Connection Status:**
    *   **Importance:**  Users should be able to easily see whether their DNS queries are being encrypted with DoH/DoT.  This provides reassurance and helps with troubleshooting.
    *   **Solution:**  Add a clear status indicator to the Pi-hole web interface (e.g., a green padlock icon) that shows whether DoH/DoT is currently active.  If DoH/DoT is not active, display a warning message and provide troubleshooting guidance.
    *   **Implementation Details:**  This requires Pi-hole to continuously monitor the status of the DoH/DoT connection and update the UI accordingly.

### 7. Side Effects and Performance

*   **Performance:**  DoH/DoT can introduce a slight performance overhead compared to unencrypted DNS due to the encryption and decryption process.  However, with modern hardware and well-optimized servers, this overhead is usually negligible.  In some cases, DoH/DoT can even be *faster* than unencrypted DNS if the ISP's DNS servers are slow or unreliable.
*   **Latency:**  The added encryption and network hops can increase latency slightly.  The choice of DoH/DoT provider can significantly impact latency.  Choosing a provider with servers geographically close to the user can minimize this.
*   **Compatibility:**  DoH/DoT is generally compatible with most networks and devices.  However, some older or very restrictive networks might block DoH/DoT traffic.
* **Increased Bandwidth:** Because of encryption overhead, there is a slight increase in bandwidth.

### 8. Alternative/Complementary Strategies

While DoH/DoT is a strong mitigation strategy, it can be complemented by other security measures:

*   **DNSSEC:**  DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide cryptographic authentication of DNS data, ensuring that the responses are authentic and have not been tampered with.  DoH/DoT encrypts the *channel*, while DNSSEC validates the *data*.  They are complementary.  Pi-hole supports DNSSEC validation.
*   **VPN:**  A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts *all* internet traffic, not just DNS queries.  This provides a higher level of privacy and security but also introduces more overhead.
*   **Firewall:**  A firewall can be configured to block unencrypted DNS traffic (port 53), forcing all DNS queries to go through DoH/DoT.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keeping Pi-hole software up-to-date is crucial for patching any security vulnerabilities.

### 9. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Use Trusted Upstream DNS Servers with DoH/DoT" mitigation strategy is a highly effective way to protect against DNS eavesdropping and tampering.  The Pi-hole implementation is generally well-designed, but there are areas for improvement.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Implement Automatic DoH/DoT Fallback:**  This is the most critical recommendation.  Pi-hole should never silently fall back to unencrypted DNS.  Implement a prioritized list of DoH/DoT servers and a "fail closed" or "fail secure (with warning)" mechanism.
2.  **Simplify DoH/DoT Configuration:**  Expand the list of pre-configured DoH/DoT providers and automatically populate the endpoint URLs.
3.  **Add DoH/DoT Connection Status:**  Provide a clear visual indicator of the DoH/DoT connection status in the web interface.
4.  **Educate Users:**  Provide clear and concise documentation within the Pi-hole interface and on the Pi-hole website about the benefits of DoH/DoT, how to configure it, and how to choose a reputable provider.
5.  **Consider DNSSEC:**  Encourage users to enable DNSSEC validation in conjunction with DoH/DoT.
6.  **Regularly Review Provider List:** Keep the list of preconfigured DoH/DoT providers up to date, and periodically review their privacy policies and security practices.
7. **Monitor Performance:** Provide tools or guidance for users to monitor the performance impact of DoH/DoT and choose optimal providers.

By implementing these recommendations, the Pi-hole project can further enhance the security and usability of its DoH/DoT implementation, providing users with a robust and privacy-respecting DNS solution.
