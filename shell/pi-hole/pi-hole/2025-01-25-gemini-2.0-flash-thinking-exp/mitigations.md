# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pi-hole/pi-hole

## Mitigation Strategy: [Redundant DNS Resolution](./mitigation_strategies/redundant_dns_resolution.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify a reliable secondary DNS server. This could be a public DNS server or another internal DNS resolver.
    2.  **Configure Pi-hole to use the secondary DNS server as an upstream DNS server.** This is done within the Pi-hole admin interface under "Settings" -> "DNS" -> "Upstream DNS Servers". Ensure Pi-hole is configured to use both its primary upstream DNS and the chosen secondary DNS.
    3.  Test the configuration by simulating a Pi-hole service disruption (e.g., temporarily stopping `pihole-FTL`) and verifying that DNS resolution continues to function, relying on the secondary upstream DNS configured in Pi-hole.
    4.  Document the configured upstream DNS servers within Pi-hole for future maintenance.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Pi-hole Service Outage (High Severity): If the primary upstream DNS configured in Pi-hole becomes unavailable, Pi-hole can still resolve queries using the secondary upstream DNS.
    *   Upstream DNS Server Issues (Medium Severity): Problems with a single upstream DNS server configured in Pi-hole can be mitigated by having a functional secondary upstream DNS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Pi-hole Service Outage: Medium Reduction - Reduces impact of *upstream* DNS outages as Pi-hole can switch to a secondary upstream. Does not mitigate Pi-hole *itself* being down.
    *   Upstream DNS Server Issues: High Reduction - Significantly reduces impact of issues with a single upstream DNS server configured in Pi-hole.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Pi-hole Configuration: Pi-hole is configured with multiple upstream DNS servers in the "Upstream DNS Servers" settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   N/A - Currently implemented within Pi-hole configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Pi-hole Health and Availability](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_pi-hole_health_and_availability.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement a monitoring solution to actively monitor the Pi-hole server.
    2.  **Configure monitoring checks to specifically verify Pi-hole's core services are running (e.g., `pihole-FTL.service`, `lighttpd`) and that the Pi-hole web interface is accessible.**
    3.  Set up alerts to trigger notifications when Pi-hole services become unavailable or when performance metrics (e.g., DNS query latency *as reported by Pi-hole*) exceed predefined thresholds. Pi-hole provides API endpoints that can be used for monitoring.
    4.  Regularly review Pi-hole monitoring data and alerts to proactively identify and address potential issues before they impact application availability.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Pi-hole Service Outage (High Severity): Without monitoring, Pi-hole outages can go unnoticed, leading to prolonged application disruptions.
    *   Performance Degradation of Pi-hole (Medium Severity): Slow DNS resolution *within Pi-hole* can negatively impact application performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Pi-hole Service Outage: High Reduction - Drastically reduces the time to detect and respond to Pi-hole outages, minimizing application downtime.
    *   Performance Degradation of Pi-hole: Medium Reduction - Enables early detection of Pi-hole performance issues, allowing for timely intervention.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Infrastructure Monitoring System: Basic server availability monitoring (ping) is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Pi-hole Service-Level Monitoring:  Detailed monitoring of Pi-hole *services* (FTL, lighttpd) and DNS query performance *from Pi-hole's perspective* is not fully implemented. Alerting for Pi-hole specific failures needs enhancement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Application-Specific Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/application-specific_whitelisting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify domains essential for the application's functionality that might be mistakenly blocked by Pi-hole's default blocklists.
    2.  **Create a Pi-hole whitelist specifically for the application.** This is done through the Pi-hole web interface under "Whitelist" or by directly editing Pi-hole's whitelist configuration files (e.g., `/etc/pihole/whitelist.list`).
    3.  Thoroughly test the application with the whitelist applied in Pi-hole to ensure all necessary resources are accessible and the application functions correctly.
    4.  Document the application-specific whitelist within Pi-hole and the rationale behind each whitelisted domain for future reference.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   False Positives Blocking Legitimate Domains (Medium Severity): Pi-hole's blocklists might inadvertently block domains required for the application, causing broken features.

*   **Impact:**
    *   False Positives Blocking Legitimate Domains: High Reduction - Eliminates application functionality issues caused by Pi-hole blocking essential domains by explicitly allowing them in Pi-hole's whitelist.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Whitelist: A general whitelist exists in Pi-hole for common internal domains, but it's not application-specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Application-Specific Pi-hole Whitelist: No dedicated whitelist *within Pi-hole* exists for each application, leading to potential false positives and manual Pi-hole whitelist adjustments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Pi-hole and Blocklists](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_pi-hole_and_blocklists.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a schedule for regularly updating Pi-hole software to the latest stable version. **Utilize Pi-hole's built-in update mechanisms (`pihole -up`) or automate this process using scripting and scheduling tools (like `cron`).**
    2.  **Configure Pi-hole to automatically update its blocklists on a regular basis (e.g., daily or weekly). This is configured within the Pi-hole web interface under "Settings" -> "Update" or via command-line tools (`pihole -g`).**
    3.  Monitor Pi-hole update processes and logs (accessible via Pi-hole's web interface or log files) to ensure updates are applied successfully and identify any issues.
    4.  Subscribe to Pi-hole community forums or release notes to stay informed about security vulnerabilities and necessary updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Pi-hole (High Severity): Outdated Pi-hole software might contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
    *   Outdated Blocklists (Medium Severity):  Outdated blocklists reduce Pi-hole's effectiveness in blocking new threats.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Pi-hole: High Reduction - Significantly reduces vulnerability risk by keeping Pi-hole software updated.
    *   Outdated Blocklists: Medium Reduction - Improves Pi-hole's filtering effectiveness by ensuring blocklists are current.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Automated Blocklist Updates: Pi-hole is configured to automatically update blocklists weekly via its built-in settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated Pi-hole Software Updates: Pi-hole software updates are currently manual. Automating `pihole -up` via `cron` or similar is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Management for Pi-hole](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_management_for_pi-hole.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Utilize configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) to manage Pi-hole configurations as code.
    2.  **Define Pi-hole configurations (e.g., blocklists, whitelists, DNS settings, enabled/disabled status) in configuration files managed by the chosen tool.  This can involve using Pi-hole's command-line interface (`pihole -a`, `pihole -g`, `pihole -w`, `pihole -b`) or directly manipulating Pi-hole's configuration files.**
    3.  Use the configuration management tool to deploy and enforce consistent Pi-hole configurations across all instances.
    4.  Version control Pi-hole configuration files to track changes and enable rollback.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Configuration Drift and Inconsistency (Medium Severity): Manual Pi-hole configuration leads to inconsistencies and management difficulties.
    *   Manual Configuration Errors (Medium Severity): Manual configuration is error-prone, potentially causing security issues or disruptions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Configuration Drift and Inconsistency: High Reduction - Ensures consistent Pi-hole configurations, simplifying management and reducing errors.
    *   Manual Configuration Errors: High Reduction - Minimizes manual errors by automating configuration management.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial Configuration Management: Some server provisioning is managed with Ansible, but Pi-hole *specific* configurations are largely manual.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full Configuration Management for Pi-hole: Comprehensive configuration management for Pi-hole *itself*, including blocklists, whitelists, and settings, is not yet implemented using tools like Ansible to directly configure Pi-hole.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Staging Environment for Configuration Changes](./mitigation_strategies/staging_environment_for_configuration_changes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Set up a staging Pi-hole environment that mirrors the production Pi-hole environment.
    2.  **Before deploying any changes to Pi-hole configuration or blocklists in production, first apply and test them in the staging Pi-hole environment.** This includes testing whitelist/blacklist changes, DNS settings modifications, and update procedures.
    3.  Thoroughly test the impact of Pi-hole configuration changes in staging, including DNS resolution and application functionality *with the staging Pi-hole*.
    4.  Only deploy Pi-hole configuration changes to production after successful testing in staging.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unintended Consequences of Configuration Changes (Medium Severity): Deploying Pi-hole configuration changes directly to production without testing can cause unexpected issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unintended Consequences of Configuration Changes: High Reduction - Significantly reduces production issues by testing Pi-hole changes in staging first.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   General Staging Environment: A general staging environment exists, but a *dedicated staging Pi-hole* is not explicitly used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated Pi-hole Staging: A dedicated staging environment specifically for testing Pi-hole configuration changes is not yet in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Pi-hole Access](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_pi-hole_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Restrict access to the Pi-hole administration interface (web UI and SSH access) to only authorized personnel.
    2.  **Implement strong authentication for Pi-hole access.  Pi-hole supports setting a password for the web interface. Consider further hardening SSH access to the Pi-hole server itself.**
    3.  **Utilize Pi-hole's built-in user management (if available in future versions, currently limited) or operating system level user management to control access.**
    4.  Regularly review and audit user access to Pi-hole.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Pi-hole (Medium Severity): Broad access increases the risk of unauthorized modifications to Pi-hole.
    *   Insider Threats (Medium Severity): Excessive privileges can be exploited by malicious insiders.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Pi-hole: Medium Reduction - Reduces unauthorized access by limiting access and enforcing authentication.
    *   Insider Threats: Medium Reduction - Mitigates insider threats by limiting privileges.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Access Control: Access to Pi-hole web interface is password protected.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Role-Based Access Control: Pi-hole lacks built-in RBAC. More granular access control and potentially MFA for Pi-hole administration are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Pi-hole Hardware and Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_pi-hole_hardware_and_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Ensure Pi-hole is running on adequate hardware resources.
    2.  **Optimize Pi-hole configuration settings for performance. This includes adjusting Pi-hole's caching settings (within "Settings" -> "DNS" -> "Interface settings" and "Advanced DNS settings"), DNS resolver settings ("Settings" -> "DNS" -> "Upstream DNS Servers"), and potentially reducing the number or type of blocklists used ("Settings" -> "Adlists").**
    3.  Regularly monitor Pi-hole resource utilization (CPU, RAM, disk I/O) *on the Pi-hole server* to identify constraints. Pi-hole provides some basic system resource information in its web interface dashboard.
    4.  Consider using lightweight blocklists and optimizing the number of blocklists enabled *within Pi-hole's adlist settings*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Performance Degradation due to Pi-hole (Low Severity): Insufficient resources or suboptimal Pi-hole configuration can slow down DNS resolution.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Performance Degradation due to Pi-hole: Medium Reduction - Reduces performance degradation by ensuring Pi-hole is well-resourced and optimally configured.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Hardware Provisioning: Pi-hole is on VMs with standard resources.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Performance Optimization and Resource Monitoring: Pi-hole configuration is not specifically performance-tuned. Resource monitoring *of the Pi-hole server itself* for performance tuning is not actively performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [DNS Caching Considerations](./mitigation_strategies/dns_caching_considerations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure Pi-hole's built-in DNS caching (FTL caching) is enabled and properly configured. This is enabled by default in Pi-hole.**
    2.  **Tune DNS caching parameters within Pi-hole's advanced DNS settings ("Settings" -> "DNS" -> "Advanced DNS settings") to optimize cache size and TTL values.**
    3.  Monitor DNS cache hit rates *within Pi-hole's statistics dashboard* and adjust caching configurations as needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Performance Degradation due to DNS Resolution Latency (Low Severity):  Excessive DNS resolution latency can impact application performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Performance Degradation due to DNS Resolution Latency: Medium Reduction - Reduces DNS latency by leveraging Pi-hole's caching, improving performance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Pi-hole Caching: Pi-hole's default caching is enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Caching Parameter Tuning: Pi-hole's caching parameters are at default values and not actively tuned for optimal performance based on application needs. Monitoring of Pi-hole's cache hit rate for tuning is not implemented.
