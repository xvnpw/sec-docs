# Threat Model Analysis for apache/spark

## Threat: [Malicious Code Execution on Executors](./threats/malicious_code_execution_on_executors.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in user-defined functions (UDFs), or dependencies to inject and execute arbitrary code on the Spark Executor nodes. This could involve crafting malicious input data or providing a compromised UDF.

**Impact:** Full control over the Executor process, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, denial of service on the Executor, or lateral movement within the cluster.

**Affected Component:** Spark Executors (specifically the task execution environment, UDF handling).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for data processed by Spark.
* Use secure coding practices when developing UDFs and avoid using dynamic code execution where possible.
* Employ sandboxing or containerization techniques for Executor processes to limit the impact of compromised Executors.
* Regularly update Spark and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement robust access controls to prevent unauthorized users from submitting or modifying jobs.

## Threat: [Driver Program Compromise](./threats/driver_program_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker could target vulnerabilities in the Driver program, potentially through exposed network ports, insecure configurations, or exploitation of dependencies within the Spark Driver process. Successful compromise could grant the attacker control over the entire Spark application.

**Impact:** Full control over the Spark application, including the ability to submit arbitrary jobs, access sensitive data managed by the Driver, and potentially disrupt the entire cluster.

**Affected Component:** Spark Driver (including its web UI, job submission endpoints, and communication with the Cluster Manager).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the Driver program's network interfaces and restrict access to authorized users and systems.
* Disable unnecessary services and features on the Driver.
* Regularly update Spark and its dependencies.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Driver's web UI and job submission mechanisms.
* Run the Driver in a secure environment with appropriate resource isolation.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Job Submission](./threats/unauthorized_job_submission.md)

**Description:** An attacker could bypass Spark's authentication and authorization mechanisms to submit malicious Spark jobs to the cluster. These jobs could be designed to steal data processed by Spark, consume excessive resources within the Spark cluster, or disrupt other Spark applications.

**Impact:** Resource exhaustion within the Spark cluster, denial of service for legitimate Spark applications, data breaches of data accessible by Spark, and potential compromise of the Spark cluster.

**Affected Component:** Spark Cluster Manager (Standalone Master, YARN Resource Manager, Kubernetes Master's interaction with Spark), and potentially the Driver's job submission interface if not properly secured.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable authentication and authorization for the Spark Cluster Manager.
* Implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict job submission to authorized users and applications.
* Secure the communication channels between the Driver and the Cluster Manager.
* Monitor job submissions for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Executors](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_executors.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has compromised a Spark Executor could leverage its access to data partitions being processed by Spark to exfiltrate sensitive information. This could involve sending data to external systems directly from the Executor.

**Impact:** Data breaches and exposure of confidential information managed and processed by the Spark application.

**Affected Component:** Spark Executors (specifically their access to data partitions and communication capabilities).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures within the Spark application and the environment.
* Monitor network traffic from Executor nodes for unusual data egress.
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the Spark cluster.
* Implement strong access controls to limit the data accessible by individual Executors.
