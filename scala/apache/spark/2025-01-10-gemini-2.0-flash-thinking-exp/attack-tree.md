## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Spark Driver Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_spark_driver_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Critical Node: Unsecured Driver Configuration:**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exposed JMX Port:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers identify an exposed Java Management Extensions (JMX) port on the Spark Driver.
        *   Attack Vector: They exploit vulnerabilities in the JMX Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service, such as deserialization flaws (e.g., Log4Shell), to execute arbitrary code on the driver.
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to access the Spark Driver UI or API using weak or default credentials.
    *   Impact: Successful exploitation grants significant control over the Spark application, allowing for data access, manipulation, or complete takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Malicious Job Submission](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_malicious_job_submission.md)

*   Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious code directly into the Spark Driver process by manipulating SparkContext configuration parameters, such as `spark.driver.extraJavaOptions`. This allows them to add arbitrary Java options, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers submit a Spark job that contains malicious code designed to exploit vulnerabilities or perform unauthorized actions when executed on the driver. This can involve including malicious libraries or crafting code to interact with the underlying system in a harmful way.
    *   Impact: Successful injection or submission allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the driver, potentially compromising the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Spark Master/Cluster Manager Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_spark_mastercluster_manager_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Critical Node: Unsecured Master Configuration:**
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to access the Spark Master UI or API using weak or default credentials.
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers identify exposed ports on the Spark Master without proper authentication. This allows them to directly interact with the Master's API to submit malicious jobs or manipulate cluster resources.
    *   Impact: Successful exploitation grants control over the Spark cluster, allowing for resource manipulation, job control, and potentially impacting other applications running on the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Spark Job Submission Process](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_spark_job_submission_process.md)

*   Attack Vector: Attackers submit Spark jobs that include modified or entirely malicious JAR dependencies. When these JARs are loaded and executed by the Spark application, they can perform unauthorized actions.
*   Attack Vector: Attackers intercept the job submission process and alter configuration parameters before the job is launched. This could involve changing resource allocations, adding malicious libraries, or modifying the job's execution logic.
*   Impact: Successful exploitation allows attackers to introduce malicious code into the Spark environment or manipulate job execution for their benefit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Breakdown: Compromise Application via Spark Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_breakdown_compromise_application_via_spark_exploitation.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and is critical because successful exploitation at this level means the application's security has been breached through Spark vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Breakdown: Unsecured Driver Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_breakdown_unsecured_driver_configuration.md)

This is a critical node because it represents a fundamental security weakness that opens the door to multiple high-impact attacks. If the driver configuration is insecure, many other attacks become much easier to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Breakdown: Exposed JMX Port](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_breakdown_exposed_jmx_port.md)

This is a critical entry point for attackers, particularly for exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities that can lead to immediate remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Breakdown: Weak or Default Credentials for Driver UI/API](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_breakdown_weak_or_default_credentials_for_driver_uiapi.md)

This represents a simple but effective way for attackers to gain initial access to the driver and potentially launch further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Breakdown: Malicious Job Submission](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_breakdown_malicious_job_submission.md)

This node is critical because it represents a direct mechanism for attackers to introduce and execute malicious code within the Spark environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Breakdown: Unsecured Master Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_breakdown_unsecured_master_configuration.md)

Similar to the driver configuration, this is a critical node because it provides attackers with a foothold to control the entire Spark cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Breakdown: Weak or Default Credentials for Master UI/API](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_breakdown_weak_or_default_credentials_for_master_uiapi.md)

This provides a straightforward way for attackers to gain control over the Spark Master.
