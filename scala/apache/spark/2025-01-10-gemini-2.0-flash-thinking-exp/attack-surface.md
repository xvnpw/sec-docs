# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/spark

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Driver and Executors](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_driver_and_executors.md)

*   **Description:**  Spark uses serialization (often Java serialization) for inter-process communication between the Driver and Executors, and when persisting data. Vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious serialized objects.
    *   **How Spark Contributes:** Spark's distributed nature and reliance on serialization for data exchange make it susceptible to deserialization attacks if not handled carefully. The default use of Java serialization, which has known vulnerabilities, increases this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker submits a Spark job containing a specially crafted serialized object that, when deserialized by the Driver or an Executor, exploits a known vulnerability in a library used by the deserialization process, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Driver or Executor nodes, potentially leading to complete compromise of the Spark application and the underlying infrastructure. Data breaches, service disruption, and privilege escalation are possible.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure serialization libraries like Kryo and configure them securely.
        *   Sanitize and validate data received from untrusted sources before deserialization.
        *   Keep Spark and its dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider isolating the Driver process and Executors in separate security zones.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and Transformations](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_user-defined_functions__udfs__and_transformations.md)

*   **Description:** Spark allows users to define custom functions (UDFs) and transformations that are executed on the Executors. If these user-provided code snippets are not properly sandboxed or validated, malicious actors can inject arbitrary code.
    *   **How Spark Contributes:** Spark's flexibility in allowing custom logic to be executed on the cluster creates an opportunity for code injection if security measures are not in place.
    *   **Example:** A developer unknowingly includes a vulnerable third-party library in a UDF, which an attacker can exploit by crafting specific input data that triggers the vulnerability during UDF execution on an Executor.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution on Executor nodes, potentially leading to data exfiltration, resource manipulation, or denial of service. Compromised Executors could be used as a pivot point to attack other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit all user-provided code and dependencies.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for data processed by UDFs.
        *   Explore sandboxing techniques or containerization to isolate UDF execution.
        *   Restrict the permissions of the user accounts running Spark Executors.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Spark Web UIs](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_spark_web_uis.md)

*   **Description:** Spark provides web UIs for monitoring and managing applications. If these UIs are not properly secured with authentication and authorization, attackers can gain access to sensitive information and potentially manipulate the cluster.
    *   **How Spark Contributes:** Spark's built-in web UIs, while useful, expose a management interface that requires careful security configuration. The default configurations might not be secure enough for production environments.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses an unsecured Spark Master UI and views sensitive job configurations, including database credentials embedded in the Spark configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (job configurations, environment variables, application details), potential for unauthorized job submission or cancellation, and denial of service by manipulating cluster settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication and authorization for all Spark web UIs (Driver UI, Master UI, Worker UI, History Server UI).
        *   Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., Kerberos, LDAP).
        *   Restrict access to the web UIs to authorized users and networks.
        *   Disable the web UIs if they are not required.
