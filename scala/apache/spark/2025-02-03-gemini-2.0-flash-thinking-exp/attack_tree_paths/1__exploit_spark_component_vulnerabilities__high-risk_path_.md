---

###### 1.1.1.1. Unauthenticated Access to Web UI [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:**  This is a critical misconfiguration where the Spark Web UI is enabled but lacks any form of authentication.

**Attack Vector:** Web UI enabled without authentication.

**Action:** Access sensitive information, modify configurations, submit malicious jobs.

**Technical Details:**  An attacker can directly access the Web UI through a web browser without providing any credentials. This allows them to view application details, environment variables, logs, and potentially interact with the Spark application depending on the Web UI features enabled.  In some cases, unauthenticated access can be combined with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.

**Impact:** High risk. Unauthenticated access allows attackers to:

*   **Information Disclosure:** Access sensitive application metadata, configurations, environment variables (potentially containing credentials), and logs.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** Modify Spark application configurations through the Web UI, potentially disrupting operations or weakening security.
*   **Malicious Job Submission (in some cases):** Depending on the Web UI features and Spark version, attackers might be able to submit jobs or interact with running applications in unintended ways.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

###### 1.1.1.2. Web UI Remote Code Execution (RCE) (if vulnerabilities exist) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - CRITICAL IMPACT]

**Description:** This is a severe vulnerability where an attacker can exploit a flaw in the Web UI to execute arbitrary code on the Driver node.

**Attack Vector:** Exploit known or zero-day RCE vulnerability in Web UI components.

**Action:** Gain shell access to Driver node.

**Technical Details:** RCE vulnerabilities in web applications can arise from various sources, including:

*   **Input Validation Flaws:**  Improper handling of user input in Web UI components can lead to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, SQL injection, template injection) that can be leveraged for RCE.
*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** If the Web UI uses deserialization for handling data, vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries can be exploited for RCE.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Web UI Dependencies:**  Third-party libraries used by the Web UI might contain known RCE vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Critical impact. Successful RCE on the Driver node grants the attacker complete control over the Driver process and potentially the entire host system. This can lead to:

*   **Full System Compromise:**  Attacker gains shell access to the Driver node, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, and pivot to other systems.
*   **Data Breach:**  Attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored on or accessible from the Driver node.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attacker can disrupt the Spark application and potentially the entire cluster.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

---

##### 1.1.2. Deserialization Vulnerabilities in RPC Communication [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - CRITICAL IMPACT]

**Description:** Spark uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) for communication between Driver and Executors, and between cluster components. Deserialization vulnerabilities in the RPC framework can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vector:** Exploit known deserialization flaws in Spark's RPC framework (e.g., using Java serialization).

**Action:** Execute arbitrary code on Driver or Executors.

**Technical Details:** Spark historically used Java serialization for RPC communication. Java serialization is known to be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. If Spark is configured to use vulnerable serialization mechanisms or if vulnerabilities exist in the deserialization process itself, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects. When these objects are deserialized by the Driver or Executors, they can trigger arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Critical impact. Deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attacker can execute arbitrary code on the Driver and/or Executors, gaining control over these nodes.
*   **Data Breach:**  Attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data processed by Spark.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attacker can disrupt the Spark application and potentially the entire cluster.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised Driver or Executors can be used as a pivot point to attack other systems in the network.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Use Kryo Serialization:** **Critical Mitigation:** Configure Spark to use Kryo serialization instead of Java serialization. Kryo is generally considered more performant and less vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
*   **Secure RPC Configuration:**  Review and harden Spark's RPC configuration, ensuring secure communication channels and minimizing exposure to external networks.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement input validation and sanitization for data received through RPC to prevent malicious serialized objects from being processed.
*   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Spark and its dependencies updated to patch any known deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Spark cluster components within a secure network segment to limit the attack surface.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Implement IDS/IPS to detect and prevent malicious RPC traffic.
*   **Consider alternative serialization methods:** Explore and evaluate more secure serialization libraries if Kryo is not sufficient for specific security requirements.

---

#### 1.2. Exploit Executor Vulnerabilities

**Description:** Executors are responsible for executing tasks within a Spark application. Exploiting Executor vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain control over individual Executors and potentially access data processed by them.

**Technical Details:** Attacks targeting Executors can leverage code injection vulnerabilities through UDFs or malicious job submissions, or exploit vulnerabilities in the Executor process itself.

**Impact:** High risk. Executor compromise can lead to data breaches, resource abuse, and disruption of Spark application tasks.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Executor Isolation:**  Isolate Executors from each other and from other systems in the network using network segmentation and containerization.
*   **Resource Limits:**  Enforce resource limits on Executors to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:**  Monitor Executor activity and logs for suspicious behavior.
*   **Secure Executor Configuration:** Harden the operating system and network configuration of Executor nodes.

---

##### 1.2.1. Code Injection via User-Defined Functions (UDFs) or Spark Jobs [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:** If applications allow users to define and submit UDFs or Spark jobs without proper security controls, attackers can inject malicious code that will be executed within the Executor context.

**Technical Details:** This attack vector relies on the application's trust in user-provided code or job specifications.

**Impact:** High risk. Code injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on Executors, data access, and resource abuse.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Restrict UDF Usage:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of user-defined functions (UDFs) if possible. If UDFs are necessary, carefully control and restrict their usage.
*   **UDF Sandboxing and Sanitization:** If UDFs are allowed, implement strict sandboxing and input sanitization to prevent malicious code execution. Consider using secure UDF execution environments or language subsets.
*   **Job Submission Authorization and Authentication:** Implement strong authentication and authorization controls for job submission to prevent unauthorized users from submitting malicious jobs.
*   **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Review UDF code and job specifications for potential security vulnerabilities before deployment. Use static analysis tools to detect code injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Executor processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of code injection.

---

###### 1.2.1.1. Malicious UDF Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into User-Defined Functions (UDFs) that are then executed by Spark Executors.

**Attack Vector:** Application allows users to define and submit UDFs without proper sanitization/sandboxing. [CRITICAL NODE]

**Action:** Execute arbitrary code within Executor context, access data on Executor node.

**Technical Details:** If the application allows users to provide UDFs (e.g., in Python, Scala, or Java) without proper validation or sandboxing, an attacker can craft a UDF that contains malicious code. When this UDF is executed by an Executor, the malicious code will run with the privileges of the Executor process.

**Impact:** High risk. Malicious UDF injection can lead to:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution on Executors:** Attacker can execute any code they want within the Executor's environment.
*   **Data Access and Exfiltration:** Attacker can access data processed by the Executor, including sensitive data, and exfiltrate it.
*   **Resource Abuse:** Attacker can use the Executor's resources for malicious purposes, such as cryptocurrency mining or launching attacks on other systems.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised Executors can be used as a pivot point to attack other systems in the network.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Restrict UDF Usage:** **Strongly Recommended:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of user-defined functions (UDFs) if possible, especially from untrusted sources.
*   **UDF Whitelisting:** If UDFs are necessary, implement a strict whitelisting approach, allowing only pre-approved and thoroughly vetted UDFs.
*   **UDF Sandboxing:**  If dynamic UDFs are required, implement robust sandboxing mechanisms to isolate UDF execution and prevent access to sensitive resources or system calls. Consider using secure execution environments or language subsets with restricted capabilities.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Sanitize and validate inputs to UDFs to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Thoroughly review and analyze UDF code for potential security vulnerabilities before deployment. Use static analysis tools to detect malicious code patterns.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Executor processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of malicious UDF execution.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Monitor UDF execution and log suspicious activity.

###### 1.2.1.2. Malicious Job Submission [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the job submission mechanism and submits malicious Spark jobs designed to perform harmful actions.

**Attack Vector:** Attacker gains access to job submission mechanism (e.g., via compromised application logic or credentials). [CRITICAL NODE]

**Action:** Submit jobs that perform malicious actions, data exfiltration, or resource abuse.

**Technical Details:** If the job submission process is not properly secured, an attacker who gains access to the submission mechanism (e.g., by compromising application credentials, exploiting API vulnerabilities, or gaining unauthorized network access) can submit malicious Spark jobs. These jobs can be crafted to perform various malicious actions.

**Impact:** High risk. Malicious job submission can lead to:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Malicious jobs can be designed to extract sensitive data from Spark datasets and send it to an attacker-controlled location.
*   **Data Manipulation or Corruption:** Jobs can modify or corrupt data within Spark storage or processing pipelines.
*   **Resource Abuse and Denial of Service:**  Jobs can be designed to consume excessive resources, leading to denial of service for legitimate applications.
