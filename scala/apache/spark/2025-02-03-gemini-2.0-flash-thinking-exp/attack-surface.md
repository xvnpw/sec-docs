# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/spark

## Attack Surface: [1. Unauthenticated Access to Spark Master/Worker/History Server UIs and APIs](./attack_surfaces/1__unauthenticated_access_to_spark_masterworkerhistory_server_uis_and_apis.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of authentication on Spark web UIs and APIs allows unauthorized access to cluster management interfaces.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark, by default, often starts with no authentication enabled for its UIs and APIs, making them immediately accessible on the network. This is a core design aspect of Spark that introduces this attack surface if not secured.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the Spark Master UI without credentials and submits a malicious application that reads sensitive data from HDFS and sends it to an external server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Remote Code Execution (via job submission)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Cluster takeover
    *   Information Disclosure (cluster configuration, logs)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Configure Spark to use authentication for its web UIs and APIs. Options include HTTP Basic Authentication, Kerberos, or LDAP/Active Directory.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to Spark UIs and APIs to authorized networks or users using firewalls and network policies.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review access controls and authentication configurations.

## Attack Surface: [2. Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities in RPC Communication](./attack_surfaces/2__serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities_in_rpc_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Java serialization (or custom serialization) used for communication between Spark components (Master, Worker, Driver, Executors).
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark heavily relies on Java serialization for RPC, which is known to be a source of vulnerabilities if not handled carefully. This is inherent to Spark's distributed communication architecture.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload and sends it to a Spark Master or Worker node. Upon deserialization, this payload executes arbitrary code on the target node.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Spark nodes (Master, Worker, Driver)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Privilege Escalation
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Kryo Serialization (Where Possible):** Kryo is a faster and generally safer serialization library than standard Java serialization. Configure Spark to use Kryo where applicable.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for data being serialized and deserialized, especially when dealing with external data sources.
    *   **Keep Spark and Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Spark and its dependencies (including Netty and serialization libraries) to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [3. Job Submission Vulnerabilities (Malicious Job Execution)](./attack_surfaces/3__job_submission_vulnerabilities__malicious_job_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers submitting malicious Spark jobs that can execute arbitrary code, access data, or disrupt the cluster.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark's architecture allows for dynamic job submission, which, if not properly controlled, can be abused to execute unauthorized code within the cluster. This is a core feature of Spark that becomes an attack surface if not secured.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a job submission endpoint (e.g., through an unsecured API or compromised user account) and submits a Spark job that reads sensitive data, modifies data, or performs system commands on worker nodes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on worker nodes
    *   Data manipulation or corruption
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Privilege Escalation (if Spark application runs with elevated privileges)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Job Submission Endpoints:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for job submission endpoints (e.g., using Spark's ACLs, secure APIs, or gateway services).
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization for Job Parameters:** Validate and sanitize all job parameters and user-provided code to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Resource Quotas and Limits:** Implement resource quotas and limits to prevent malicious jobs from consuming excessive resources and causing DoS.
    *   **Code Review and Sandboxing:** Review user-provided code for security vulnerabilities. Consider using sandboxing techniques to restrict the capabilities of submitted jobs.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Spark applications with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of compromised jobs.

## Attack Surface: [4. Spark UI Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/4__spark_ui_cross-site_scripting__xss__and_cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Spark UIs that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts (XSS) or forge requests on behalf of authenticated users (CSRF).
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark provides web UIs for monitoring and management. If these UIs are not developed with security in mind, they can be vulnerable to common web attacks like XSS and CSRF. This is a direct consequence of Spark providing these web interfaces.
*   **Example (XSS):** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a Spark UI page (e.g., through a crafted application name or log message). When an administrator views this page, the script executes, stealing their session cookie.
*   **Example (CSRF):** An attacker tricks an authenticated Spark user into clicking a malicious link that performs an administrative action on the Spark cluster without the user's knowledge.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Account takeover (session hijacking)
    *   Unauthorized actions on the Spark cluster
    *   Information disclosure
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Spark UI code to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. (Note: This is primarily for Spark developers to address in the Spark codebase itself, but users benefit from updated versions).
    *   **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., CSRF tokens) in the Spark UI to prevent CSRF attacks. (Again, primarily for Spark developers).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating XSS risks. (Can be configured by users in some web server setups, but primarily a development concern).
    *   **Regular Security Scanning:** Rely on Spark project's security scanning and updates. Users should keep their Spark versions updated.
