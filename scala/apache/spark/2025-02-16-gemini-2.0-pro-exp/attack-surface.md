# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/spark

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_network_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Data transmitted between Spark components (Driver, Executors, Shuffle Service) is intercepted or modified in transit.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark uses RPC and network-based shuffle, creating multiple points for network interception.  This is inherent to Spark's distributed nature.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as the Spark cluster uses a packet sniffer to capture shuffle data containing sensitive customer information.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS/SSL:** Configure Spark to use TLS/SSL for *all* communication channels (`spark.network.crypto.enabled`, `spark.ssl.*` properties).  This is mandatory for secure operation.
    *   **Strong Ciphers:** Use strong, up-to-date cipher suites.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Spark components on a dedicated network segment, limiting exposure.
    *   **Authentication:** Implement authentication (e.g., SASL with `spark.authenticate`) to verify the identity of communicating components.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated/Unauthorized Access to Spark UI/REST API](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticatedunauthorized_access_to_spark_uirest_api.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to the Spark UI or REST API, exposing cluster information, application details, and potentially sensitive data.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark *provides* a web UI and REST API for monitoring and management, which can be exposed without authentication by default. This is a Spark-provided feature.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the Spark UI is publicly accessible and uses it to view environment variables containing database credentials. They then use the REST API to kill running jobs.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, potential credential theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Configure authentication for the Spark UI and REST API (`spark.ui.authentication`). This is a direct Spark configuration.
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Use a robust authentication mechanism (Kerberos, LDAP, or a custom filter).
    *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to the UI and API to authorized users and networks (firewall rules, reverse proxy).
    *   **Disable if Unnecessary:** If the UI/API is not needed, disable it entirely.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection (UDFs, Dependencies)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection__udfs__dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into the Spark cluster through user-defined functions (UDFs), custom JARs, or compromised dependencies.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark's *ability to execute user-provided code* (UDFs) and load external libraries (JARs) creates an avenue for code injection. This is a core feature of Spark's extensibility.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a Spark job with a malicious UDF that executes a shell command to download and run malware on the worker nodes.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review and validate *all* user-provided code (UDFs, transformations) that will be executed by Spark.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a secure dependency management system and *verify* the integrity of Spark dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Signing:** Implement code signing to verify the integrity and authenticity of JARs loaded by Spark.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Spark's serialization/deserialization process to achieve remote code execution.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark *relies heavily on serialization* for data transfer and persistence, making it susceptible to deserialization attacks. This is fundamental to Spark's operation.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends crafted, malicious serialized data to a Spark application that uses a vulnerable version of a serialization library. Upon deserialization, the attacker's code is executed.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Spark Updated:** Regularly update Spark and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities. This is crucial for mitigating Spark-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Data:** Do not deserialize data from untrusted sources within Spark applications.
    *   **Safer Serialization (If Possible):** If feasible, consider using more secure serialization formats (e.g., Avro, Protocol Buffers) that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities than Java serialization, *specifically within the Spark context*.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify libraries with known deserialization issues that are used by Spark.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Spark SQL](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_spark_sql.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into Spark SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark SQL *allows users to execute SQL queries* against DataFrames, creating a potential vector for SQL injection. This is a Spark-provided feature.
*   **Example:** A web application allows users to filter data using a text input field. The application constructs a Spark SQL query by directly concatenating the user's input without sanitization. An attacker enters `' OR '1'='1` to bypass filtering and retrieve all data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, unauthorized data access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) whenever possible. Spark's DataFrame API provides a safer way to construct queries programmatically, *avoiding direct SQL string manipulation*.
    *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user input before using it in *Spark SQL queries*.
    *   **Avoid String Concatenation:** Do *not* build Spark SQL queries by concatenating strings with user input.
