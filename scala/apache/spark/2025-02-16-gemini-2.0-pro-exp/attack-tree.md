## Attack Tree Path: [8. Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/8__deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   `[!]` **Critical Node**
*   `-->` **High-Risk Path**
*   **Description:** Spark uses serialization/deserialization for data and code transfer. Attackers can inject malicious serialized data, potentially achieving RCE. Java deserialization vulnerabilities are a major concern.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Highly dependent on whether untrusted data is deserialized)
*   **Impact:** **Very High** (Complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium to **High** (Finding and exploiting a deserialization vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert (Requires expertise in exploiting deserialization flaws)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** **Hard** (Often needs advanced intrusion detection and code analysis)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Crucially:* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources. This is the primary defense.
    *   If deserialization is unavoidable, use safe serialization libraries with whitelisting.
    *   Rigorously validate data *before* deserialization.
    *   Keep Spark and all dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Exploiting Vulnerabilities in User-Provided Code](./attack_tree_paths/9__exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_user-provided_code.md)

*   `[!]` **Critical Node**
*   `-->` **High-Risk Path**
*   **Description:** If users submit code (e.g., via notebooks or custom apps), attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in that code to gain control. Common in shared Spark environments.
*   **Likelihood:** **High** (Vulnerabilities are likely if users can submit arbitrary code)
*   **Impact:** **Very High** (Complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Depends on the specific vulnerability in the user's code)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Depends on the vulnerability being exploited)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to **Hard** (Requires code analysis and runtime monitoring)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Crucially:* Run user code in a sandboxed environment (containers, VMs) with limited privileges.
    *   Implement code review processes to check for security issues before deployment.
    *   Use static analysis tools to scan user code for vulnerabilities.
    *   Enforce strict input validation *within* the user-submitted code.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Compromised Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/10__compromised_dependencies.md)

*   `[!]` **Critical Node**
*   `-->` **High-Risk Path**
*   **Description:** Spark apps often use third-party libraries. A compromised library can be exploited for RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependencies are a frequent attack vector)
*   **Impact:** **Very High** (Complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Exploiting a known vulnerability in a dependency)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Exploitation of known vulnerabilities)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Vulnerability scanners can detect known compromised dependencies)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use dependency management tools (Maven, Gradle) to track dependencies.
    *   Employ vulnerability scanners (Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to find known issues.
    *   Regularly update dependencies to their latest versions to patch vulnerabilities.
    *   Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all components.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Exploiting Spark Internal Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/11__exploiting_spark_internal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   `[!]` **Critical Node**
*   `---` (Regular Path - Low likelihood, but critical impact)
*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities could exist within Spark itself, although this is less common.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Spark is well-vetted, but zero-days are possible)
*   **Impact:** **Very High** (Complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** **Very High** (Requires finding a zero-day vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Expert (Vulnerability research and exploit development)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** **Very Hard** (Zero-day vulnerabilities are unknown by definition)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep Spark updated to the latest stable release.
    *   Monitor Spark security advisories and mailing lists.
    *   Responsibly disclose any discovered vulnerabilities to the Apache Spark security team.
