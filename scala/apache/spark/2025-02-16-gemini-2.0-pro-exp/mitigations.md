# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/spark

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization (Fine-Grained Access Control)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization__fine-grained_access_control_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Fine-Grained Access Control with Spark's Security Manager and Kerberos.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication:** Set `spark.authenticate=true` in `spark-defaults.conf`. This forces Spark components to authenticate with each other.
    2.  **Configure Kerberos:**
        *   Install and configure a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).
        *   Create Kerberos principals for Spark users and services (driver, executors, history server).
        *   Distribute keytabs to the appropriate nodes.
        *   Set `spark.kerberos.principal` and `spark.kerberos.keytab` in `spark-defaults.conf` or in the application's configuration.
    3.  **Enable ACLs:** Set `spark.acls.enable=true` in `spark-defaults.conf`.
    4.  **Define View ACLs:** Use `spark.ui.view.acls` to specify users/groups allowed to view the Spark UI.  Example: `spark.ui.view.acls=data_scientists,admins`.
    5.  **Define Modify ACLs:** Use `spark.modify.acls` to specify users/groups allowed to modify running applications (e.g., kill jobs). Example: `spark.modify.acls=admins`.
    6.  **Define Admin ACLs:** Use `spark.admin.acls` for administrative actions. Example: `spark.admin.acls=super_admins`.
    7.  **Test:** Thoroughly test the configuration to ensure that only authorized users can perform the intended actions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Job Submission (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from submitting malicious Spark jobs.
    *   **Unauthorized Job Modification (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from killing or altering running jobs.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Spark UI (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from viewing sensitive information in the Spark UI.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Malicious Jobs (High Severity):** Limits who can submit jobs, reducing exfiltration risk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Job Submission:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 90%).
    *   **Unauthorized Job Modification:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 95%).
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Spark UI:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 85%).
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Malicious Jobs:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 80%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Authentication (`spark.authenticate`) is enabled.
    *   Kerberos integration is implemented for the production cluster.
    *   Basic view ACLs (`spark.ui.view.acls`) are configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Modify ACLs (`spark.modify.acls`) are *not* implemented.
    *   Admin ACLs (`spark.admin.acls`) are not implemented.
    *   Staging and development clusters lack consistent Kerberos/ACL configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Encryption (Internal Communication)](./mitigation_strategies/network_encryption__internal_communication_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Spark's Internal Communication Encryption.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Crypto:** Set `spark.network.crypto.enabled=true` in `spark-defaults.conf`.
    2.  **Configure Key Length:** Set `spark.network.crypto.keyLength` to a secure value (e.g., 256).
    3.  **Configure Key Factory Algorithm:** Set `spark.network.crypto.keyFactoryAlgorithm` (e.g., PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256).
    4.  **Configure SASL:** Ensure SASL is properly configured (often automatic with Kerberos).
    5.  **Test:** Verify encrypted communication between Spark components.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents interception of data between Spark components.
    *   **Data Snooping on the Network (Medium Severity):** Protects sensitive data during shuffle operations.
    *   **Credential Sniffing (High Severity):** Protects credentials if transmitted (though secret management should prevent this).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 95%).
    *   **Data Snooping:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 90%).
    *   **Credential Sniffing:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 95%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `spark.network.crypto.enabled` is set to `true` in production.
    *   Default key length and algorithm settings are used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Staging and development clusters lack consistent encryption.
    *   Regular review of encryption settings is not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Serialization Security](./mitigation_strategies/data_serialization_security.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid Java Serialization; Use Safer Alternatives and Validate Kryo Classes.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer Safer Formats:** Use JSON, Avro, Parquet, or ORC.
    2.  **Avoid Java Serialization:** If possible, avoid it entirely.
    3.  **Kryo (If Necessary):**
        *   Register only needed classes: `spark.kryo.registrationRequired=true` and `spark.kryo.classesToRegister`.
        *   *Do not* use `spark.kryo.unsafe=true` unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Keep Kryo updated.
        *   Consider a custom serializer with input validation.
    4.  **Input Validation:** Validate all input data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Deserialization (Critical Severity):**
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE via Deserialization:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 80-95%).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced (e.g., 70%).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (e.g., 60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The project primarily uses Parquet.
    *   Kryo is used in some cases, but `spark.kryo.registrationRequired` is *not* enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `spark.kryo.registrationRequired=true` needs to be enabled, with a maintained list of allowed classes.
    *   Formal review process for Kryo configuration is missing.
    *   Input validation is inconsistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Event Log Encryption and Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/event_log_encryption_and_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Encrypt and Authenticate Access to Spark Event Logs

*   **Description:**
    1. **Enable Encryption:** Set `spark.eventLog.encrypt=true` in `spark-defaults.conf`.
    2. **Configure Encryption Keys:**  Configure appropriate encryption keys for event log encryption.  The specifics depend on the chosen encryption method.
    3. **Secure Storage:** Ensure the event log directory (specified by `spark.eventLog.dir`) is secure.
        *   Use appropriate file system permissions.
        *   If stored remotely (e.g., HDFS), use the storage system's access controls.
        *   Consider using encryption at rest for the storage location.
    4. **Authenticated Access:**  Control access to the event logs using the storage system's authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., Kerberos for HDFS).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Historical Job Data (Medium Severity):**  Event logs can contain sensitive information about past jobs, including configuration details and potentially data samples.
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium Severity):**  Attackers could gain insights into the application's data and logic by analyzing event logs.
    *   **Tampering with Event Logs (Low Severity):**  Encryption and access controls help prevent unauthorized modification of event logs, which could be used to cover up malicious activity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 90%).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 85%).
    *   **Tampering:** Risk reduced (e.g., 75%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Event logging is enabled (`spark.eventLog.enabled=true`).
    *   The event logs are stored on HDFS with basic HDFS permissions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `spark.eventLog.encrypt=true` is *not* set. Event logs are stored in plain text. This is a major vulnerability.
    *   Strong authentication and authorization for accessing the event logs on HDFS are not fully enforced.
    *   Encryption at rest for the HDFS directory is not configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dynamic Allocation Security](./mitigation_strategies/dynamic_allocation_security.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Limits for Dynamic Allocation

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set Maximum Executors:** Use `spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors` to limit the maximum number of executors that can be allocated to an application.
    2.  **Configure Idle Timeout:** Use `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout` to specify how long an executor can be idle before it's released.
    3.  **Initial Executors (Optional):** Use `spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors` to set a reasonable starting number of executors.
    4.  **Scheduler Backend:** Ensure your scheduler backend (YARN, Kubernetes, Mesos) is also configured with appropriate resource limits.
    5. **Monitor:** Actively monitor resource usage to detect anomalies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) (Medium Severity):** Prevents a single application from consuming all cluster resources, potentially impacting other applications.
    *   **Cost Overruns (Low Severity):** In cloud environments, uncontrolled resource allocation can lead to unexpected costs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 80%) by setting appropriate limits.
    *   **Cost Overruns:** Risk reduced (e.g., 70%) by controlling resource usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dynamic allocation is enabled (`spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true`).
    *   `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout` is set.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors` is *not* set, or is set to a very high value. This allows for potential resource exhaustion.
    *   `spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors` is not configured.
    *   Regular monitoring of resource usage specifically for dynamic allocation is not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Temporary File Handling](./mitigation_strategies/secure_temporary_file_handling.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Spark's Temporary File Directories

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `spark.local.dir`:** Set `spark.local.dir` in `spark-defaults.conf` to point to a secure directory.
    2.  **Permissions:** Ensure this directory has restrictive file system permissions, allowing access *only* to the user running the Spark application.
    3.  **Encryption:** Consider using an encrypted file system or volume for `spark.local.dir`.
    4.  **Ephemeral Storage:** If possible, use a dedicated, ephemeral storage volume that is automatically wiped after the job completes.
    5. **Avoid shared directories:** Do not use shared directories like `/tmp` for `spark.local.dir`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium Severity):** Temporary files can contain intermediate data that could be sensitive.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Intermediate Data (Medium Severity):** Attackers could potentially access or modify temporary files.
    *   **Disk Space Exhaustion (Low Severity):** Uncontrolled temporary file creation could fill up the disk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced (e.g., 75%) by using secure directories and encryption.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 85%) with proper permissions.
    *   **Disk Space Exhaustion:** Risk reduced (e.g., 60%) by using dedicated, potentially ephemeral, storage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `spark.local.dir` is set to a specific directory.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The directory specified by `spark.local.dir` does *not* have sufficiently restrictive permissions. Other users on the system might be able to access it.
    *   Encryption is not used for the `spark.local.dir` directory.
    *   Ephemeral storage is not used.
