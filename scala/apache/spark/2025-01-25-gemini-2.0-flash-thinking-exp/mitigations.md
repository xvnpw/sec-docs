# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/spark

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Spark Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_spark_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Spark Authentication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configuration:** In your `spark-defaults.conf` file (or when submitting a Spark application), set the property `spark.authenticate` to `true`. This is a core Spark configuration property that activates authentication mechanisms within Spark.
    2.  **Shared Secret (Simple Authentication):** For basic authentication, configure a shared secret using the Spark property `spark.authenticate.secret`. Set this to a strong, randomly generated secret on both the Spark Master and Workers. This leverages Spark's built-in shared secret authentication.
    3.  **Kerberos (Advanced Authentication):** For more robust authentication, configure Kerberos integration within Spark. This involves setting up Kerberos principals for Spark components and configuring Spark properties like `spark.security. Kerberos.*` to use Kerberos for authentication. This utilizes Spark's Kerberos support.
    4.  **Restart Spark Components:** After configuring authentication properties, restart your Spark Master and Worker nodes for the changes to take effect within the Spark cluster.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Spark Cluster (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or processes from connecting to the Spark cluster and executing arbitrary Spark jobs or accessing Spark resources. This directly protects the Spark cluster itself.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** While authentication primarily focuses on identity, it can indirectly reduce the risk of MITM attacks during initial Spark component communication setup by establishing a secure handshake (especially when combined with Spark's SSL/TLS encryption).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Spark Cluster:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction (when combined with encryption features of Spark)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Authentication is enabled (`spark.authenticate=true`) using a shared secret in the development environment (`dev` Spark cluster configuration) via Spark configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Kerberos authentication, a more advanced Spark authentication feature, is not implemented in production (`prod`) environment. Shared secret management within Spark configuration needs improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Spark UI Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_spark_ui_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Spark UI Access
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable ACLs:** In `spark-defaults.conf` or application submission, set `spark.ui.acls.enable` to `true`. This Spark property enables Access Control Lists for the Spark UI.
    2.  **Configure Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Define authorized users and groups for UI access using Spark properties:
        *   `spark.ui.acls.groups`: Specify a comma-separated list of user groups allowed to access the UI via Spark configuration.
        *   `spark.ui.acls.users`: Specify a comma-separated list of individual users allowed to access the UI via Spark configuration.
    3.  **Restart Spark Master:** Restart the Spark Master for UI ACL changes to take effect within the Spark UI component.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Spark UI (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive application details, configurations, logs, and potentially data samples exposed through the Spark UI, which is a Spark component.
    *   **Session Hijacking via Spark UI (Low to Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of session hijacking of the Spark UI by restricting access to authenticated users through Spark's ACL mechanism.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Spark UI:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Session Hijacking via Spark UI:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** ACLs are enabled (`spark.ui.acls.enable=true`) in both `dev` and `prod` environments, with basic group-based access control configured using Spark UI ACL properties.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Integration of Spark UI ACLs with a central identity management system for user and group management is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encrypt Data in Transit (Shuffle and Broadcast)](./mitigation_strategies/encrypt_data_in_transit__shuffle_and_broadcast_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Encrypt Data in Transit (Shuffle and Broadcast)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Shuffle Encryption:** In `spark-defaults.conf` or application submission, set `spark.shuffle.encryption.enabled` to `true`. This Spark property enables encryption for shuffle data.
    2.  **Enable Broadcast Encryption:** In `spark-defaults.conf` or application submission, set `spark.broadcast.encryption.enabled` to `true`. This Spark property enables encryption for broadcast data.
    3.  **Enable RPC Encryption (SSL/TLS):** Ensure `spark.ssl.enabled` is set to `true` and related Spark SSL settings are properly configured to encrypt RPC communication between Spark components. This utilizes Spark's built-in SSL/TLS capabilities.
    4.  **Certificate Management:** Manage SSL/TLS certificates used by Spark for encryption. This is part of configuring Spark's SSL features.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Interception during Shuffle (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting sensitive data during shuffle operations, which are core Spark operations involving data transfer between executors.
    *   **Data Interception during Broadcast (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting broadcast data, a Spark mechanism for distributing data from the driver to executors.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** Encryption of data in transit using Spark's encryption features significantly mitigates the risk of MITM attacks attempting to eavesdrop on Spark communication channels.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Interception during Shuffle:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Interception during Broadcast:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Shuffle encryption (`spark.shuffle.encryption.enabled=true`) and broadcast encryption (`spark.broadcast.encryption.enabled=true`) are enabled in the `prod` environment via Spark configuration. SSL/TLS for RPC is also enabled using Spark's SSL configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Encryption for data in transit is not consistently enabled in the `dev` environment. Certificate management process for Spark SSL needs to be more robust and automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Spark Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/secure_spark_configuration_files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Spark Configuration Files
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict File System Permissions:** Ensure Spark configuration files (`spark-defaults.conf`, `spark-env.sh`, etc.) are only readable and writable by the Spark user and administrators at the OS level. This is a standard OS security practice applied to Spark configuration.
    2.  **Secure Storage Location:** Store configuration files in a secure location on the file system, not in publicly accessible directories on the systems running Spark components.
    3.  **Avoid Storing Secrets in Plain Text:** Do not store sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or shared secrets directly in plain text within Spark configuration files.
    4.  **Use Environment Variables or Secret Management:** Utilize environment variables (which Spark can read) or dedicated secret management tools to manage and inject sensitive configuration values into Spark, instead of directly in configuration files.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Configuration (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from reading or modifying Spark configurations, which could lead to security misconfigurations within Spark or exposure of sensitive information related to Spark setup.
    *   **Credential Exposure (High Severity if secrets are stored in plain text):** Mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive credentials if they are inadvertently stored in plain text in Spark configuration files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Configuration:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Credential Exposure:** High Risk Reduction (if secrets are properly managed outside of Spark config files)
*   **Currently Implemented:** File system permissions are restricted on Spark configuration files in both `dev` and `prod` environments.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Shared secret for Spark authentication is currently stored in plain text in `spark-defaults.conf` in the `dev` environment.  Need to move secrets out of plain text Spark configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debugging and Unnecessary Features in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debugging_and_unnecessary_features_in_production.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Debugging and Unnecessary Features in Production
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Spark UI History Server (if not needed):** If the Spark UI history server is not actively used for monitoring historical application data in production, consider disabling it to reduce the attack surface. This involves configuring Spark properties related to the history server.
    2.  **Disable Debug Logging:** Set Spark logging level to `WARN` or `ERROR` in production to reduce verbose debug logs that might expose sensitive information or increase performance overhead. Configure `log4j.properties` or Spark's logging configuration.
    3.  **Remove Unnecessary Spark Jars/Dependencies:** Ensure only necessary Spark jars and dependencies are included in the Spark application deployment to minimize potential vulnerabilities from unused components.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Debug Logs (Low to Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive information in verbose debug logs generated by Spark.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Low Severity):** Disabling unnecessary features and removing unused dependencies reduces the overall attack surface of the Spark deployment.
    *   **Performance Overhead (Low Severity):** Disabling unnecessary features and reducing logging can slightly improve performance in production.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Debug Logs:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Increased Attack Surface:** Low Risk Reduction
    *   **Performance Overhead:** Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Spark logging level is set to `WARN` in the `prod` environment.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Spark UI history server is still enabled in production, even though its usage is limited.  Unnecessary Spark jars and dependencies have not been systematically reviewed and removed.
