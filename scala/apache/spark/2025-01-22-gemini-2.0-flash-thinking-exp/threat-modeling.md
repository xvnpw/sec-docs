# Threat Model Analysis for apache/spark

## Threat: [Driver Process Compromise](./threats/driver_process_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Driver Process Compromise
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the driver application or its dependencies to gain control of the driver process. This could involve exploiting insecure deserialization, code injection flaws, or leveraging compromised libraries. Once compromised, the attacker can submit malicious Spark jobs, access sensitive data processed by the application, and potentially control the entire Spark cluster.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Spark application and potentially the underlying infrastructure. Data breaches, denial of service, malicious code execution within the Spark cluster, and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Affected Spark Component:** Spark Driver Program (specifically the application code running within the driver JVM).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Validation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
    *   Secure Coding Practices: Adhere to secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities.
    *   Dependency Management: Regularly update and patch driver dependencies.
    *   Least Privilege: Run the driver process with minimum necessary privileges.
    *   Hardened Environment: Consider deploying the driver in a hardened environment.
    *   Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP): Explore using RASP solutions.

## Threat: [Code Injection in Driver Application](./threats/code_injection_in_driver_application.md)
