## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthenticated Access to Web UI (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthenticated_access_to_web_ui__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Unauthenticated Web UI Access
* **How it works:** If the Spark Web UI is enabled without authentication, an attacker can directly access it via a web browser.
* **Potential Impact:** Information disclosure (job details, configurations, environment variables), modification of configurations, submission of malicious jobs, potential Denial of Service.
* **Mitigation:** Disable Web UI if not necessary, enable authentication and authorization, use strong passwords, regularly audit configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Web UI Remote Code Execution (RCE) (High-Risk Path - Critical Impact & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__web_ui_remote_code_execution__rce___high-risk_path_-_critical_impact_&_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Web UI RCE Vulnerability Exploitation
* **How it works:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Web UI components that allow for arbitrary code execution on the Driver node.
* **Potential Impact:** Critical system compromise, full control of the Driver node, data breach, complete application takeover.
* **Mitigation:** Keep Spark version up-to-date, apply security patches promptly, implement robust intrusion detection and prevention systems, minimize Web UI exposure.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Deserialization Vulnerabilities in RPC Communication (High-Risk Path - Critical Impact & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/3__deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_rpc_communication__high-risk_path_-_critical_impact_&_critical_6f34dc61.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Deserialization Exploit
* **How it works:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Spark handles deserialization of data during RPC communication (e.g., using Java serialization). Maliciously crafted serialized data can trigger code execution upon deserialization.
* **Potential Impact:** Critical system compromise, RCE on Driver or Executors, full control of Spark components, data breach.
* **Mitigation:** Disable or avoid Java serialization if possible, use secure serialization methods, keep Spark and underlying Java/Scala versions updated, implement deep packet inspection and anomaly detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Malicious UDF Injection (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/4__malicious_udf_injection__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Malicious User-Defined Function (UDF) Injection
* **How it works:** If the application allows users to define and submit UDFs without proper sanitization or sandboxing, an attacker can inject malicious code within a UDF. This code will be executed within the Executor context.
* **Potential Impact:** Code execution on Executors, unauthorized data access on Executor nodes, potential lateral movement within the cluster.
* **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for UDFs, use secure coding practices, consider sandboxing or containerization for Executors, limit UDF functionality and permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Malicious Job Submission (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/5__malicious_job_submission__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Unauthorized Job Submission
* **How it works:** An attacker gains access to the job submission mechanism (e.g., by compromising application logic, credentials, or exploiting unauthenticated access) and submits malicious Spark jobs.
* **Potential Impact:** Data breach, data exfiltration, resource abuse, application disruption, potential lateral movement within the cluster.
* **Mitigation:** Secure job submission mechanisms, implement strong authentication and authorization for job submission, audit job submissions, monitor job execution for anomalies, implement resource quotas and limits.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Resource Manager Exploitation (High-Risk Path - Critical Impact & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/6__resource_manager_exploitation__high-risk_path_-_critical_impact_&_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Resource Manager Vulnerability Exploitation
* **How it works:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying resource manager (YARN, Mesos, Standalone Master) used by Spark.
* **Potential Impact:** Cluster-wide impact, control over cluster resources, potential impact on other applications sharing the cluster, Denial of Service, data breaches.
* **Mitigation:** Keep resource manager software up-to-date, apply security patches promptly, harden resource manager nodes, implement strong access controls and security configurations for the resource manager, monitor resource manager activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Disabled or Weak Authentication (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/7__disabled_or_weak_authentication__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Authentication Bypass
* **How it works:** Spark security features (authentication, authorization) are disabled or configured with weak/default credentials, allowing unauthenticated access to Spark components.
* **Potential Impact:** Unrestricted access to Spark components, job submission, data access, configuration changes, Denial of Service.
* **Mitigation:** Always enable Spark authentication and authorization, use strong, randomly generated secrets, implement fine-grained access control using Spark ACLs or external authorization systems, regularly audit security configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Unencrypted Communication Channels (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/8__unencrypted_communication_channels__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack, Eavesdropping
* **How it works:** Communication between Spark components (Driver, Executors, Master, Workers) is not encrypted, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data in transit or perform MitM attacks.
* **Potential Impact:** Data interception, exposure of sensitive information, potential command injection via MitM attacks.
* **Mitigation:** Enable encryption for all Spark communication channels (RPC, Web UIs, data transfer) using TLS/SSL, minimize network exposure of Spark components, use firewalls and network segmentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Weak Access Controls on Data Storage (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/9__weak_access_controls_on_data_storage__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Unauthorized Data Access
* **How it works:** Spark application accesses data stored in locations (HDFS, S3, etc.) with weak or misconfigured access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access, modify, or delete data.
* **Potential Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, data loss, regulatory compliance violations.
* **Mitigation:** Implement strong access controls on data storage systems, follow the principle of least privilege, regularly audit storage access controls and configurations, consider data encryption at rest.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Outdated or Vulnerable Libraries (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/10__outdated_or_vulnerable_libraries__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation
* **How it works:** Spark application uses outdated or vulnerable versions of libraries (e.g., Hadoop, Netty, Jackson, Log4j) that contain known security vulnerabilities.
* **Potential Impact:** RCE, Denial of Service, data breach, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
* **Mitigation:** Maintain an inventory of Spark dependencies, regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities, keep Spark and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches, use dependency management tools.
