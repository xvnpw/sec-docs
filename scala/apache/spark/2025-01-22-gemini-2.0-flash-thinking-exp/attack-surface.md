# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/spark

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated/Weakly Authenticated RPC Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticatedweakly_authenticated_rpc_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Spark components (Driver, Executors, Master, Spark Connect Server) communicate via RPC. If these endpoints lack strong authentication, unauthorized access and control are possible.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark's fundamental distributed architecture relies on RPC for core operations, making unauthenticated RPC a direct and critical vulnerability point within Spark itself.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an unauthenticated Spark Master RPC endpoint to submit a malicious application. This application executes arbitrary code on worker nodes, steals sensitive data processed by Spark, or disrupts cluster operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on Spark components (Driver, Executors, Master).
    *   **Complete Cluster Takeover** allowing full control over Spark resources and data processing.
    *   **Data Exfiltration and Manipulation** of data processed within the Spark cluster.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS)** by disrupting Spark services or exhausting resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Strong Authentication:** Enforce robust authentication for all Spark RPC communication using Kerberos or Spark's secret-based authentication.
    *   **Network Isolation:** Deploy Spark clusters within private networks, restricting access to RPC ports via firewalls to only authorized internal systems.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct frequent audits of authentication configurations and access control policies to ensure ongoing security.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Spark's architecture heavily utilizes serialization and deserialization for data and code transfer between components. Deserializing untrusted data can lead to immediate Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark's core data processing and distributed execution model inherently relies on serialization. The default use of Java serialization, known for vulnerabilities, directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Spark Driver or Executor deserializes data received from an untrusted source (e.g., user-provided input, a compromised data stream) using a vulnerable serialization library. A crafted malicious serialized object, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the Spark process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on Spark Driver and Executors, leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Unrestricted Data Access and Manipulation** within the Spark application's context.
    *   **Potential for Lateral Movement** to other systems accessible from the compromised Spark component.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate Untrusted Deserialization:**  Strictly avoid deserializing data from untrusted or unverified sources within Spark applications.
    *   **Use Secure Serialization Alternatives:**  Replace Java serialization with safer alternatives like Kryo (configured securely) or consider protocol buffers or Apache Avro for data serialization.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Pre-Deserialization):** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *before* any deserialization occurs to filter out potentially malicious data.
    *   **Dependency Management and Updates:** Keep serialization libraries and all Spark dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Spark SQL](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_spark_sql.md)

*   **Description:** When user-controlled input is directly incorporated into Spark SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates a direct pathway for SQL injection attacks.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark SQL's functionality to execute SQL queries makes it susceptible to SQL injection if developers fail to use secure query construction practices within Spark applications.
*   **Example:** A Spark application dynamically builds a Spark SQL query using user-provided input to filter data. An attacker injects malicious SQL code into the input, bypassing intended filters and gaining unauthorized access to or modification of data within the connected data source.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by Spark SQL.
    *   **Data Manipulation and Corruption:** Modification or deletion of data within the data source.
    *   **Potential Privilege Escalation** within the database or data system accessed by Spark SQL, depending on connection privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Parameterized Queries:**  Always utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing Spark SQL queries that include user-provided input. This prevents direct injection of SQL code.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before they are used in any part of a Spark SQL query, even when using parameterized queries, to prevent unexpected behavior.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Connections:**  Grant Spark SQL connections to databases only the minimum necessary privileges required for intended operations, limiting the impact of potential SQL injection.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:**  Conduct regular SQL injection vulnerability testing specifically targeting Spark SQL query construction within applications.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Spark and Spark applications rely on numerous third-party libraries. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited within the Spark environment.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark's extensive dependency tree, while providing rich functionality, inherently increases the risk of including vulnerable libraries.  If not actively managed, outdated and vulnerable dependencies become a direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Spark application or the Spark runtime itself includes a vulnerable version of a logging library or a networking component. An attacker exploits a known RCE vulnerability in this dependency, gaining code execution within the Spark application or cluster.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** through vulnerable dependencies, potentially compromising Spark components and the underlying system.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS)** by exploiting vulnerabilities that cause crashes or resource exhaustion.
    *   **Information Disclosure** if vulnerabilities allow access to sensitive data or system information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability and exploitability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated tools to regularly scan Spark applications and Spark deployments for known vulnerable dependencies (e.g., using OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or similar tools integrated into CI/CD pipelines).
    *   **Proactive Dependency Updates:**  Establish a process for promptly updating vulnerable dependencies to patched versions. Prioritize security updates for all Spark dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Management Best Practices:**  Utilize robust dependency management tools (like Maven or Gradle) to manage and track dependencies effectively.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Alerts:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases to receive timely notifications about new vulnerabilities affecting Spark and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations Leading to Unprotected Services](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations_leading_to_unprotected_services.md)

*   **Description:** Spark's default configurations often prioritize ease of initial setup over robust security.  Leaving these defaults in production environments exposes critical Spark services without adequate protection.
*   **Spark Contribution:** Spark's "out-of-the-box" experience, while convenient, can be inherently insecure if users do not actively harden configurations. Default settings often lack authentication and encryption, directly contributing to the attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Spark cluster is deployed using default configurations, leaving RPC endpoints and UIs unauthenticated and exposed over the network without encryption. This allows unauthorized users to access Spark services, submit malicious jobs, and potentially eavesdrop on sensitive communication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access** to Spark components, data, and cluster resources.
    *   **Cluster Compromise and Takeover** by malicious actors.
    *   **Data Breaches** due to unauthorized access and potential eavesdropping.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS)** by disrupting Spark services or exhausting resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Can escalate to Critical if default configurations are exposed to public networks or untrusted environments).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Security Hardening:**  Treat default Spark configurations as insecure and mandate a security hardening process for all deployments, especially production environments.
    *   **Enable Authentication and Authorization by Default:**  Configure strong authentication and authorization for all Spark services (RPC, UIs, Spark Connect) as a standard practice.
    *   **Enforce Encryption for Communication:**  Enable TLS/SSL encryption for all network communication channels within the Spark cluster, including RPC and UI traffic.
    *   **Follow Security Best Practices and Guides:**  Strictly adhere to official Apache Spark security documentation and hardening guides to ensure secure configuration and deployment.
